Hi guys. So I am trying to get up to speed with my blog because lately I have not been posting a lot and due to this my blog is becoming stagnant. In this post I am going to write a book review. My friend **Mike** from **[The Mouse Vs The Python Blog][1]** recently wrote a book with the name of Python 101. He is a really talented blogger and programmer and I was waiting anxiously to read his brand new book, Python 101.

![Python 101 by Michael Driscoll](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mousecovercolor_sm-237x300.jpg)

In **Python 101** Mike has clearly explained most of the basic concepts of Python in a straight forward way. Lets be honest, while I was reading his book I was trying to search those parts of the book which I could have written better and he clearly won because there is virtually nothing I could have made better.

He takes the reader from the history of Python to making small scripts and explaining everything in between. The book is divided in 5 parts namely:

  1. Learning the basics
  2. Learning from the Library
  3. Intermediate Odds and Ends
  4. Tips, Tricks and Tutorials
  5. Packaging and Distribution

The division is really logical and helpful. The **first part** introduces you to the IDLE, strings, list comprehensions and the likes. The **second part** introduces you to a big but bite-able chunk of the Python standard library. The **third part** introduces you to the intermediate concepts like lambda, code profiling and decorators. The **forth part** contains some tutorials whereas the **fifth part** introduces you to the concept of sharing your code using PyPI and executable files.

All in all I really liked the book. I would suggest this book to all those **starting out with Python** and those who want to brush up their basic Python skills. I should also note here that although I have been programming in Python for quite some time but still I found a couple of useful tips and tricks in this book.

So that was it. I hope you will give a go to this book and don&#8217;t forget to write about your experiences with this book in the comments below. I will also ask Mike about a possibility to run a **Giveaway for this book** over here but till then hop over to his blog because **he is [running a Giveaway][3]** which is valid till the 4th of the next month that is July.

I hope you liked this review and don&#8217;t forget to follow this blog to get your daily dose of Python goodness.
