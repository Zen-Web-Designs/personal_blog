Hi there folks! I am sure you all are fine. It's been a long time since I wrote on this blog. I have some very important exams coming up due to which I was/am not able to provide the required time to this blog.

I am happy to inform you that Intermediate Python is now available in Chinese! A small group of dedicated Chinese Pythonistas took it upon themselves to translate it. Another important bit of information/achivement is that the Chinese version crossed the 1000 stars mark on GitHub much more quickly than the English one.

If you are Chinese or feel like getting your feet wet with the Chinese version of the book then head over to this [link][1]. Don't forget to star the book! You can read the English version over [here][2] or on [GitHub.][3]

Don't forget to subscribe to my blog. If you have any questions then write a comment, send me a [message on Facebook][4] or [email me.][5] I would love to hear from you.

**Note:** If the English or the Chinese version of the book helps you even a little bit then please write to me. I love to hear how people use my book. Until next time!
