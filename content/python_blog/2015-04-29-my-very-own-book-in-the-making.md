Hi there folks. I am writing a book on Python tips, tricks and patterns. This will be a short book of nearly 100 pages. I have already written about 56 pages. I would be self-publishing it in July or August. I am pretty sure that you would love this book. Here is an unsorted list of content which I have already written about:

  * args\_and\_kwargs
  * debugging
  * generators
  * map\_&\_filter
  * set\_-\_data_structure
  * ternary_operators
  * decorators
  * global\_&\_return
  * mutation
  * \_\_slots\_\_magic
  * virtual_environment
  * collections
  * enumerate
  * object_introspection
  * comprehensions
  * exceptions
  * lambdas
  * one_liners
  * for\_-\_else
  * open_function
  * targeting\_python\_2_3
  * coroutines
  * function_caching

Do note that this list of included contentÂ is subject to change as it is just a rough draft right now. I am planning on including a lot more topics.

If you would like to get an early sneak peak and a reduced price then I would suggest you to signup <a title="Mailing list" href="http://github.us3.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=20b1036063aec6dbf068cc8c0&id=4d261653c5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on my mailing list over here</a>. A lot of people have already signed up. Make sure that you sign up and avail this opportunity of having the final book at a reduced price.

That's it for today. I would be seeing you later!
