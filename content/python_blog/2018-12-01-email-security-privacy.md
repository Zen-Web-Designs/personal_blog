Hi everyone! I hope all of you are doing well. Things have been super exciting on my side. Just got done with a file system checker project in C for my Operating Systems class. It was mentally draining but equally rewarding. This blog post is not about Python but rather about Emails.

This week I also gave a department wide talk at Colgate University on Email security and privacy and some of the SMTP features which are available at your disposal. It went fairly successful. This was a result of my own independent research on the topic. I tried to cover as much base as possible while also trying to keep the talk engaging.

If you want to learn more about the topic, you can take a look at the slides I used and do some research of your own. If something seems wrong please let me know in the comments below so that we all can benefit. You can also access (I think?) the speaker notes for more context behind the content on the slides.

**If you are pressed for time, skip to the last slide to learn about some interesting attacks. One of them makes use of Cyrillic script. If you haven't heard of Cyrillic script before you would love that slide.**

I would love to hear from you all. Please share your views in the comments below about the talk or anything in general.
