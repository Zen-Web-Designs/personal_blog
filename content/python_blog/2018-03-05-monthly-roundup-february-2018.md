In this tutorial, you&#8217;ll learn to create a simple Discord bot with Python. In case you don&#8217;t know what Discord is, it is a Slack-like service aimed at gamers essentially. In Discord, you can join multiple servers, and you must have noticed that these servers have many bots. These bots can do a lot of things, from playing music for you to simple chat moderations. I was really fascinated by these bots, so I decided to write one of my own using Python. So, let&#8217;s jump right in!

I wanted to develop such a skill which was not available online and which contained a certain level of twists so that it wasn’t boring. The main idea is that you can tell Alexa to carry out different commands on your system remotely. This will work even if your system/computer is in your office and you and your Alexa are at home.

After my Loop Better talk at PyGotham 2017 someone asked me a great question: iterators are lazy iterables and range is a lazy iterable in Python 3, so is range an iterator?

Data Visualization is a big part of a data scientist&#8217;s jobs. In this blog post, we&#8217;re going to look at 6 data visualizations and write some quick and easy functions for them with Python&#8217;s Matplotlib.

<a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-matplotlib-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>9. Python Plotting With Matplotlib (Guide + Example Code)</strong></a>

A picture says a thousand words, and with Python&#8217;s matplotlib library, it fortunately takes far less than a thousand words of code to create a production-quality graphic. However, matplotlib is also a massive library, and getting a plot to look just right is often practiced on a trial-and-error basis. Using one-liners to generate basic plots in matplotlib is fairly simple, but skillfully commanding the remaining 98% of the library can be daunting. This article is a beginner-to-intermediate-level walkthrough on matplotlib that mixes theory with example.

What languages should you learn, and why should you invest your time in learning them? As this is a site devoted to Python, we&#8217;ve already told you why Python is a great language to learn. What we&#8217;re going to do now is tell you about eight top-tier companies that you know that use Python.

<a href="https://fosstack.com/algorithms-with-python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>11. Learn Algorithms with Python</strong></a>

In this post, we will explore how to get started with data structures and algorithms. So if you are a novice programmer or one who has no computer science background then you are reading something worth your time.

<a href="https://dbader.org/blog/difference-between-is-and-equals-in-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>12. The Difference Between “is” and “==” in Python</strong></a>

Python has two operators for equality comparisons, “is” and “==” (equals). In this article I’m going to teach you the difference between the two and when to use each with a few simple examples.

As developers, we can be at either sides of the equation. We can be both the provider or the consumer of an API. However, in this tutorial we are going to explore the consumption part of the equation. We are going to write some code that consume public APIs.

<a href="https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2018/02/05/python-tuples-are-immutable-except-when-theyre-mutable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>14. Python Tuples are Immutable, Except When They&#8217;re Mutable</strong></a>

In Python, tuples are immutable, and &#8216;immutable&#8217; means the value cannot change. These are well-known, basic facts of Python. While tuples are more than just immutable lists (as Chapter 2 of Luciano Ramalho&#8217;s excellent &#8220;Fluent Python&#8221; explains), there is a bit of ambiguity here. Luciano has written up a great blog post on this topic as well. Before we can get a nuanced answer to &#8220;Are tuples mutable or immutable?&#8221;, we need some background information.
