Hi everyone! :wave: After transitioning to a static blog/website, I had one problem. My blog no longer had comments functionality. Yes, I could have used Disqus but I personally hate it. It is bloated with a lot of unwanted code. I did some search a while ago but couldn't find anything. I did a more serious search a couple of weeks ago and stumbled upon [staticman](https://staticman.net/) and holy moly it is the best thing ever! It allows me to integrate comments in my blog for free and also allows me to style them in any way I want! However, setting up staticman wasn't a walk in the park. 

In this post I will list all the steps required to setup staticman on a static blog. I am going to be using hugo for this post as my blog is based on hugo.
