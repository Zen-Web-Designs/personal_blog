Hi everyone! :wave: Remember I wrote a [post recently](https://yasoob.me/posts/using-baofeng-ht-radio-as-police-scanner/) about how you can listen to your local police department using a Baofeng? As it turns out, most police and fire departments have moved to trunked radio. Trunked radio is just a fancy way of saying that these departments have gone digital. A Baofeng UV-5X3 or UV-5R radio can not decode this communication. 

You have two options. You will either have to buy an expensive radio from Motorolla or Kenwood that supports digital modes or you can use a $25-$35 RTL-SDR. I made a short video to guide you through the whole process of ordering an RTL-SDR, finding the frequency of your local PD, and setting everything up in the SDRTrunk software.
