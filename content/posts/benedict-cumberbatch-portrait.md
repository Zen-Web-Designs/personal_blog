Hi everyone! :wave: It's a tough time for everyone and we are all doing what we can to stay sane. I haven't written on the blog in a long time and now I feel like I have all the time in the world to do it. I have started focusing more on my art and just made this portrait of Benedict Cumberbatch. 

This piece was done in Procreate on an iPad. I haven't done a lot of portraits and this is probably the first color portrait I have ever done. Definitely a long way to go but its progress! :smile:
