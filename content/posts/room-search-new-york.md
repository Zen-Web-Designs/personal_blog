**Update: I have found a super nice place and I am all set. Thank you everyone!**

~~Hi lovely people! :wave: You guys were able to help me before when I was searching for an internship and now I need your help again. I am planning on moving to New York City from 11th May till 4th August and need a place to stay.~~

~~I had a place to stay until last night. I was subletting a single bedroom in an apartment of 2 bedrooms from someone. However, as fate would have it, he backed out at the last minute and now I don't have a place to stay.~~

~~If you live in the city and know of anyone who might be subletting a single room from 11th May till 4th August please let me know. I am looking for someplace with a commute of fewer than 30 minutes to the World Trade Center.~~
