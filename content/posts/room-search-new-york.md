Hi lovely people! :wave: You guys were able to help me before when I was searching for an internship and now I need your help again. I am planning on moving to New York City from 11th May till 4th August and need a place to stay.

I had a place to stay until last night. I was subletting a single bedroom in an apartment of 2 bedrooms from someone who was planning on being away from the city for the summer. However, as fate would have it, his plan didn't work out and he has to stay in the city and now I am without a place to stay. He backed our less than a week before I am planning on moving to the city.

**If you live in the city and know of anyone who might be subletting a single room from 11th May till 4th August please let me know. I am looking for someplace with a commute of fewer than 30 minutes to the World Trade Center.**

You can email me at hi@yasoob.me Have a good day!
