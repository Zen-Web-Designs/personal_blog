Hi everyone! :wave: I recently sat down with [Justin Duke](https://jmduke.com/), an engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), and talked about tech, startups and time management. Along with a full-time job, Justin runs two startups ([Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/), [Spoonbill](https://spoonbill.io/)), manages two weekly newsletters, runs, and volunteers. Come learn about how he does it all! 

This is the trial run of a podcast idea I have had for a while. I might continue recording similar interviews in the future. You can also listen to this episode on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4KNSqBUu9bM2WjS23yhoNN).
