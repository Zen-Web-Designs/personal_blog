Hi beautiful people! :wave: Recently I decided to go all-in on static site generator, Hugo, and move over my [Python Tips](https://pythontips.com) blog from Wordpress to Hugo. I will share the exact steps I took during this migration. It was slightly more involved than I would have liked. I will not share the reasoning behind why I moved to Hugo in this post, but rather just the details of how the process went.

## Some context

My Python Tips blog was hosted on wordpress.com and had been there since 2013. As part of this migration I moved the blog to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io
), the comments to [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), and host the new static blog on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Exporting the content from Wordpress

The first step was to actually export the posts from my Wordpress account. I used the [wordpress-to-hugo-exporter](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter) plug-in. I had a free account on Wordpress.com so I couldn't use the plugin directly. What I ended up doing was:

- Go to the admin panel of your Wordpress.com (or .org) website and choose "Export All" content

![export-data-wordpress](/images/wordpress-migration/export-data-wordpress.png)

- Set up a local Wordpress instance using [docker4wordpress](https://github.com/wodby/docker4wordpress)

```bash
\Desktop\docker4wordpress> docker-compose.exe up -d
Creating network "docker4wordpress_default" with the default driver
Creating my_wordpress_project_portainer ... done
Creating my_wordpress_project_mailhog   ... done
Creating my_wordpress_project_php       ... done
Creating my_wordpress_project_mariadb   ... done
Creating my_wordpress_project_traefik   ... done
Creating my_wordpress_project_nginx     ... done
```

- Go to [localhost](http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/) and after setting up Wordpress use the Wordpress Importer 

![import-wordpress-dump](/images/wordpress-migration/import-wordpress-dump.png)

- Install the [wordpress-to-hugo-exporter](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter) plug-in

![install-wordpress-hugo-plugin](/images/wordpress-migration/install-wordpress-hugo-plugin.png)

- Go to tools and click on "Export to Hugo"

![export-to-hugo](/images/wordpress-migration/export-to-hugo.png)

Depending on how your original website was set-up the exported `zip` file will contain a bunch of folders. One folder will be `posts` which will contain all the blog-posts and the rest of the folders will be for different pages you might have made in your Wordpress website.

These were the folders that I ended up with:

```
books  config.yaml  index.md  python-resources  python_blog  sample-page
```

The `wordpress-to-hugo-exporter` plugin appends an absolute path as `url` property in each of the markdown files. For instance, look at the `url` property in the metadata of one of the exported posts:

```

This is what allows your old post links to work in Hugo. Now no matter where you put these files/folders inside the `content` directory in Hugo, Hugo will serve the right post. For example, normally if a file called `article.md` is stored in `content -> posts -> article.md` then Hugo will normally serve it at the `website.com/posts/article.md` endpoint. But if `article.md` has a `url` property defined then Hugo will serve `article.md` at that endpoint.

## Cleaning up the markdown posts

The output from `wordpress-to-hugo-exporter` wasn't super clean. There were a couple of issues with the output.

1. Code was wrapped up in `<pre>` tags and not `<pre><code>`. That wasn't actually the plugin's fault. Because of how Wordpress was rendering my code blocks, I used to just wrap them up in `pre` instead of `pre + code` tags. 
2. There were spaces before some `:`, `.`, and `?` in the markdown files. This was mainly in the posts I wrote in 2013. I am not sure whether this was caused by the plugin or whether my posts already had those spaces in them. 
3. The `<img>` tags were using `http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/` as the base URL for images. I could have gone back and set up a custom URL in the admin panel of my local Wordpress installation to change the base URL but I decided to just go back and manually clean up lingering HTML tags (there were quite a few `<divs>` rolling around).

After cleaning up lingering HTML tags, converting `<pre>` tags to proper `<pre> + <code>` tags, removing extra whitespaces, and fixing the image sources, I was good to go.

## Copying the images

The `wordpress-to-hugo-exporter` also puts the `wp-content` folder in the zip file. Just copy the `wp-content` folder to the `static` folder in the `static` folder in the base of your Hugo source folder. There will be quite a few extra files than the ones you actually need to serve the website. For instance, your images will have 2-3 different copies of various dimensions. I personally just let the files stay there in the `wp-content` folder. You might or might not want to do something else with them.

## Converting comments to Staticman

As you might already know, I use [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) for comments on this static blog. I have written [previously](https://yasoob.me/posts/staticman_comment_notifications_mailgun/) about how to [set it up](https://yasoob.me/posts/running_staticman_on_static_hugo_blog_with_nested_comments/). I planned to export the old Wordpress blog comments to the YAML format which Staticman uses. The way Staticman works is that it creates a folder with the same name as the filename for a post (without the extension) and then puts comments for that particular post within that folder with the `comment-<timestamp>.yml` name. 

I came across a super basic [Python script](https://github.com/dancwilliams/wordpress_to_staticman_comments) written by [Dan](https://dancwilliams.com/) which did something similar to what I wanted to do. I ended up modifying his script quite a lot to suit my own needs. [You can get my script from here](https://github.com/yasoob/wordpress_to_staticman_comments). Unlike the original script, my script is Python 3 compatible and actually saves the YAML output in folders in the proper structure.     

I ended up having to go back and update some of the comments to include proper `<pre>` and `<code>` tags as appropriate. The default output was usable but I wanted to improve the legibility of code in certain important comments. This wasn't a big deal. I only had to edit a few comments.

## Hosting the blog on Netlify

I host my static blog on Netlify. This allowed me access to certain goodies. I could create new features for my blog and put them in a new branch (in the same repo which Netflix uses to build my blog) and open up a PR against the master branch, Netflix would generate a test build from the Hugo source files in the new branch. This meant that I could see whether my Python Tips posts, pages, and comments would display correctly on the final website or not.

One other useful Netlify feature which I use is the `Checklink` plugin.

![enable-checklinks-plugin](/images/wordpress-migration/enable-checklinks-plugin.png)

This plugin runs link checks whenever I push new changes to the Hugo repo and fails the Netlify build if there are any broken link issues. This helped me find a couple of broken links to images in the blog source. It's free and doesn't add a lot of overhead. I would recommend to enable it. It will save you from the broken link embarrassment :smile_cat: 

So, in short, the Netlify process went basically like this:

-  Copy over the posts from  `wordpress-to-hugo-exporter` output and put them in the posts folder
- Copy over the comments to the `data` folder
- Enable the `Checklinks` plugin in Netlify
- Commit these new files in a new branch in the blog folder
- Open a PR against the `master` branch and wait for Netlify to generate test build
- Verify the test build and merge the PR

## Setting up a redirect in Wordpress

This part is targeted to Wordpress.com users. There are already a few guides for wordpress.org users out there. If you are a Wordpress.com user, you need to go to [Site Redirect](https://wordpress.com/domains/add/site-redirect/) and add the domain to which you want to redirect your Wordpress.com blog.

![setup-wordpress-redirect](/images/wordpress-migration/setup-wordpress-redirect.png)

Once you add the redirect, Wordpress.com will automatically redirect all new users to the new hostname while keeping the URL path in-tact. This means that all new users who open up `oldblog.wordpress.com/2019/05/29/article/` will now automatically be redirected to `newdomain.com/2019/05/29/article/`.

When I originally added the redirect the new blog wasn't already set-up. So it is always useful to keep a reset link in handy as well. To turn off the redirect you need to go to [domains/manage](https://wordpress.com/domains/manage/), click on "Change primary" and then select whichever previous domain you were using.

![reset-wordpress-redirect](/images/wordpress-migration/reset-wordpress-redirect.png)

Fun fact: When my blog started redirecting before I had actually copied over the articles to the new blog I panicked â€‹ :fearful: I couldn't even see the "Change primary" button. Instead of changing the primary, I ended up deleting the redirect altogether.â€‹ So take it from me, always learn how to reverse an action before actually taking it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Closing remarks

If you have followed the instructions exactly then by this point you have successfully migrated your wordpress.com blog (with comments) to a static Hugo blog. I am not gonna lie, this whole process was quite tedious. I spent a considerable amount of time making sure my posts were formatted correctly in Markdown format. But the result was quite satisfying. 

My blog isn't yet open source. I don't know why I haven't gotten around to making it public. I think the only thing which makes me think twice before making a repo public is what if there were some lingering secrets in the repo. I know there aren't probably any secrets in this repo but I have to be sure before I actually make it public. Maybe that will be my next project? :thinking:

If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to post a comment below. Even if I am personally unable to help out, I am sure someone else will chime in. 

That's all for today beautiful people. I will see you in the next article. Have a great day! :heart: :wave:
