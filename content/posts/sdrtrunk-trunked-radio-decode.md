Hi lovely people! :wave: Last year, I saw a guy at Colgate walking around with a huge antenna and that is when I met someone in person for the first time who was interested in radio stuff. That propelled me to explore this field a bit more because it was always super exciting for me to see what kind of stuff people can do with radios. That is when I got my hands on an RTL-SDR dongle as well. 

Fast forward a year and I still hadn't done anything useful with the RTL-SDR and the primary reason was that almost all of the tools for this dongle were either Windows based or Linux based. Mac based tools were almost non-existent and the ones which did exist, I wasn't able to get them to work. Or at least that was the case until this week. I decided to give it another go and thankfully this try was more successful than the last ones. 

In this article I will be sharing two of the tools I used and what I was able to do with them. 

The first tool/program was CubicSDR. I was able to listen to local radio with it. The interface was fairly straight forward and you can scroll the frequency graph to scrub to a different frequency. However, there were certain frequencies which looked pretty
