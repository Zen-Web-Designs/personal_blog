Hi people! :wave: Hope everything is going well with you all. I recently started exploring graphics and [processing](https://processing.org/). Processing is a wonderful software which allows you to program graphics very easily. You can get some amazing results with only a few lines of code. I have produced some basic sketches so far. I am going to link them below. Hope you like (at least some) them :grin:

If you want to learn how to make cool art using processing then I would highly recommend you to watch some videos of Daniel Shiffman on YouTube. He publishes on "[The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/videos)" channel. He is officially my favourite YouTuber :D Watching him being goofy is never tiring. 

That's all for today people. Till next time! Can't wait to read your comments/suggestions :heart: I will link all these videos on the [art projects]({{<relref "arts.md">}}) page.
