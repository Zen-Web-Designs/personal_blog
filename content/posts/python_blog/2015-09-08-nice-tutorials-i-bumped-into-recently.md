Hi guys! I am in the USA right now. I am here to attend a Hackathon at the University of Michigan called MHacks 6. This is my first ever Hackathon so I am very excited. So now without wasting any time let's get down to business. I recently came across a lot of nice tutorials which I believe might be useful for you guys. I am listing them below in no particular order:

1. ## [Diagnosing Memory 'Leaks' in Python][1]

This is an old article (2013) but still contains some gems in it. I learned about the resources module whileÂ going through this tutorial. It is more or less a 'checklist' of how to diagnose the memory leaks.

2. ## [Creating beautiful REST APIs with Flask][2]

This is a really nice presentation on how to create beautiful REST APIs with Flask. It shows you the types of decorators you might need and when you should opt for a decorator. It also shows you how to avoid some basic mistakes which one encounters while developingÂ APIs.

3. ## [Why Python over PHP][3]

I think that I might be the only one who likes argumentativeÂ and opinionated discussions once in a while. Well, if you are somewhat like me then you would enjoy reading this discussion. It tells you why and why not you should opt for Python in place of PHP.

4. ## [10 Reasons to Love SQL Alchemy][4]

This is again a very nice post. It lists the major + points of SQL Alchemy and lists the reasons for why one would and should love SQL Alchemy.

5. ## [Comparing Python Command-Line Parsing Libraries &#8211; Argparse, Docopt, and Click][5]

In this post the author shares the similarities and differences between some famous command-line parsing libraries. If you are into command-line programming then make sure to check it out.

That's it for now. I will update this postÂ when I get some free time. I hope that you guys find this post useful. It's goodbye time for now ðŸ™‚

P.S If you somehow happen to attend MHacks then do send me an [email][6] or a message on [Facebook][7]. I would **LOVE** meet you!
