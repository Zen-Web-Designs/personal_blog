**Update:** Thank you so much! I got an amazing opportunity with Azure Cloud Networking team at Microsoft üôÇ

Hi lovely people! üëã Hope everything is going well on your end. I asked you guys last year for helping me find a kick-ass internship and you all came through. I ended up working at ASAPP over the summer and had an awesome time. I <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/internship-experience-at-asapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote an article about what I learned during my internship</a>.

I am putting out the same request for next summer as well. If you have benefited from any of my articles and work at an amazing company and feel like I would be a good addition to your team, please reach out. <strong>I am looking for a 12-14 week internship from around mid-May to mid-August in 2020</strong>. I strongly prefer small teams where I can bond with the people I am working with. I am open to most places but bonus points if you work at a hardware based tech company or a fintech startup. However, this is not a hard requirement.


If you are working at an innovative company in some major European country and can sponsor Visa, I would be really interested in that as well!

I have done a lot of backend development in Python and GoLang. I am fairly comfortable with dabbling in the front-end code as well. I have also tinkered with <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/project-greenhouse-arduino-raspberry-pi-sensors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source hardware</a> (Arduino & Raspberry Pi) and wrote a <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/yl-69-soil-sensor-arduino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple</a> <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/temperature-light-intensity-sensor-arduino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of</a> <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/connecting-lcd-with-arduino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">articles</a> about what I did and how I did it. You can take a look at <a href="https://yasoob.me/resume.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my resume (PDF)</a> to get a better understanding of my expertise. You can also read about how I got into programming through <a href="https://pythontips.com/2017/12/01/how-i-got-into-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a>.

tldr: I love working with exciting stuff even if it means I have to learn something completely new!

I hope you guys would come through this time as well. Have a fantastic day and keep smiling. If you have any questions/comments/suggestions, please comment below or send me an email at yasoob.khld at gmail.com.

See ya! ‚ô•Ô∏è
