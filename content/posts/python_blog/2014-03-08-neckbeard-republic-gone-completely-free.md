So guys I have a good news for you. If you keep up with latest news regarding Python then  you might have heard about [Neckbeard Republic][1] in the past. If you haven't then let me tell you that Neckbeard Republic is a series of bite sized Python screen-casts created by the awesome [Mahdi][2]. 

It used to be paid. Only a few screen-casts were free. The paid ones required you to pay $9 monthly membership fee. However Mahdi recently announced that all those screen-casts are now free! Due to some personal problems he was not able to continue the awesome series of screen-casts so he just made them free for all of us. 

The screen-casts have a professional quality. Some of the topics covered in his screen-casts are:

  * [Django Celery Part 2][3]
  * [Sphinx & Read the Docs][4]
  * [Python Mocking][5]
  * [Pandas Data Frames][6]
  * [Django Custom Template Tags][7]
  * [And a whole lot more!][8]
  
Make sure that you check them out and tell me that whether you like them or not. I will be waiting to hear your response.
