The makers of the hugely popular Python IDE **PyCharm** recently announced a community edition of their Python IDE.  **JetBrains** announced that they will be offering a community Edition of PyCharm however it will have some stripped down features for example it will not have builtin support for pyramid etc. 

However the news for a Community version of PyCharm became hot in the python community recently because PyCharm is currently the best IDE available for Python. This community edition has been out for quite some time now and has already been downloaded by a lot of developers. Today the Source code of this IDE was also open sourced by JetBrains. The source code is available on  [GitHub][1] . This IDE has a lot of cool features. Here are a few of the features of the community version:

  * Intelligent Editor, with code completion, on-the-fly error highlighting, auto-fixes, etc.
  * Automated code refactorings and rich navigation capabilities
  * Integrated debugger and unit testing support
  * Native VCS integrations
  * Customizable UI and key-bindings, with VIM
  * emulation available
  * And much more, all available under the Apache 2 license

I hope you are as much excited as I am. I have already taken this IDE for a test drive and have been fascinated by it's power. It is a one stop solution  for every python developer whether he is a system engineer or a web developer. I hope you will take this IDE for a test drive. Do share your experience in the comments below so that others can know about your experience and don't forget to follow this blog if you want to get latest news, tips, tricks and tutorials relating to python.
