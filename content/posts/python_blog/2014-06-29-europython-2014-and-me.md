Hi guys! It's been really long since I last posted on this blog. I was a littleÂ busy these past few days.Â AÂ lot has been happening. I also got two job offers, although compelling but I still refused, so that I could focus on school for now. However, here I am, back to you guys! I would like to share someÂ huge news with you. Guess what? I will be giving a presentation at EuroPython this year!Â Anyone of you who is planning to attendÂ to EuroPython is invited to listen to my talk on the 22nd of July at 11 o'clock. I will be speaking about Webscraping in Python.

I have prepared a lot for this conference because it is going to be my first ever conference. I am really proud to have been selected for this conference. As you are my loyal readers so as a token of appreciation I am going to give you a sneak peak at my presentation so that you can get a taste about what the presentation is going to be like so that you can make up your mind that whether you want to come or not.

Without further ado,Â <a title="Webscraping in Python- Scrapy" href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> is the link to the presentation. I also started writing a book recently about how I made <a title="pastebin in python flask" href="https://github.com/yasoob/logit-bin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logit-bin</a>. I think that those books which focus on a particular project are a lot more helpful if you are not aiming to write a reference book. Just pray that I complete that book soon and get a chance to share it with you guys.

I always look forward to yourÂ motivating comments, so don't forget to leave one below. I am sure I will get to see some of you guys at EuroPython on 22nd July. Do say hi! ðŸ™‚
