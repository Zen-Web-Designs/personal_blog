Hi there folks! :wave: I have a good news for you. I have got two coupons for a video course on Udemy. The name of the course is "[Learn Python GUI programming using Qt framework][1]" and costs $79. It is taught byÂ Bogdan Milanovich. I have taken this course previously when I was just getting started with GUI development in Python. At the time when I took this course it was incomplete but now it appears as ifÂ theÂ instructor has completed the course.

The contents of the courseÂ can be checked from [here][1].

The coupons are valid for only 100 people in total. I don't want to waste them and want to give them only to thoseÂ who are really interested in this course. The course costs $79 in total but with theÂ coupon I have, you can get it for free.

There are a couple of ways you can ask me for the coupon. The first one is to [email][2] me. Secondly, you canÂ send me a message through my [Facebook page][3] and lastly you can comment on this post and IÂ would get back to you.

Till next time! Goodbye! ðŸ™‚
