Hi there folks! I have been wanting to write a post on this blog for quite some time now but life always gets in the way. This time it was my exams. Hopefully I will get free after the 4th of June and would get more time to write posts and do stuff which I love and care about.

So enough with the rant now. I wanted to write about my latest endeavor. This month, with the help of two people (whom i had never met before), I got a chance to inspire 40 teens into taking their first step into programming. This whole event was planned and organized by one badass lady, [Elena Sinel][1], who managed almost everything by herself.

I was asked by Elena to give a motivational + tutorial session to the students of Tech City College, London. I was pretty stoked by this opportunity because I love inspiring people and helping them as much as I can. This has been the theme of my life for quite a bit of time now.

Apart from a couple hiccups in the live video stream, the session went fairly well. It was coordinated by Charlie Ringer on the other end. He did an awesome job and helped to make sure that things went smoothly. He provided hands-on support to the kids whenever they needed it.

The best moment for me was when Elena told me that the kids were pretty inspired by my story of how I got started with programming and what I have achieved through it. Elena has written a short summary of the event [over here][5]. Do read it if you want to get some more detailed information about the whole session.

**If you are an educator and want me to deliver a session for you at your institute and inspire your students just let me know.** I am sure you won't regret it.

If you have any questions then please let me know in the comments below. I would love to answer as many of them as possible.

Cheers!
