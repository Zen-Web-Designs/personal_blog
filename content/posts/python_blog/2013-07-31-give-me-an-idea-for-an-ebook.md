Hi there fellas. Today i am going to ask you for a favour. I am going to write an ebook about python. I want you to give me some ideas about what i should write. This Ebook is going to be short. It will be between 10 to 20 pages because it's my first ebook. 

Currently i have two topics in mind. The first one is to write an introductory ebook about how to get started with python. This will be for beginners and will include the installation and setting up of python as well as some introductory tutorials. 

The other topic is to write about how i made the [soundcloud searcher and downloader][1]. All the backend programming of soundcloud searcher and downloader is done in python. This ebook will contain all the methods and resources I used to make this soundcloud searcher and downloader as well as how I got it working on google app engine. 

In my opinion the second topic will be more useful for you guys as most of us are looking for these type of ebooks. 

What do you say? If you want me to write about any other topic then do tell me in the comments below and I will see.
