![Book Cover](/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cover.png)

Hey folks! I amÂ feeling really proud to announce the completion of my very own book.Â After a lot of hard-work and sheer determination this became possible and "Intermediate Python" saw the light of day. It will receive updates over time ðŸ™‚

Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore.

The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like it when I was beginning to learn Python.

If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book.

Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given.


I have decided to distribute it for free! I am sure that it would help those who really want to be helped. Best of luck!

Here are the links:
- <a href="http://book.pythontips.com">HtmlÂ </a>
- <a href="http://readthedocs.org/projects/intermediatepythongithubio/downloads/pdf/latest/">PDF</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/IntermediatePython/intermediatePython">GitHub</a>
  
P.S: The book is open-source so if you find a typo just send over a pull request.Â Moreover, if you want to add more content to this book then kindly submit a pull request and I would be more than happy to merge it. ðŸ™‚

**Note: You can now donate me as well if you want to by buying the [donation version of Intermediate Python from Gumroad][2]Â ðŸ™‚**

It is only for $6 but if you want to pay less or more then kindly let me know and I can give you a custom link.

Last but not the least, if you read this book and find it helpful then a personal email and a tweet about it would mean a lot to me.

See you later!
