Hi there guys. I am back again with yet another useful post. This one is going to be about free Python books. Most new Python programmers don't realise that there are great Python books out there for free and due to their lack of knowledge they pay for expensive ones. Most of these books have the same high quality material which you would expect from a paid book. So without wasting any time let me list them here.
