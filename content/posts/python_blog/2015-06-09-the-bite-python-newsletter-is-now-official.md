Hi there guys! If you have been following my recent posts then you might know that I have started a newsletter. This newsletter covers everything related to Python which I come across every week. 

It was just a part time project. I used to send emails without any schedule. Now I have decided to give it the focus and energy which it demands. For that I have made a schedule. The newsletter will be sent out every Sunday if everything goes well. This makes it a weekly newsletter. It even has it's [own homepage][1] now! I suggest you to signup for the newsletter as it would allow you to stay upto-date with the happenings in the Python community.

Do you want to check out our recent issue? [Here you go.][2] If you have any questions regarding the newsletter and the information it will cover then just comment below and I would be happy to answer!

**P.S:** We even have our own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freepythontips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page</a>.
