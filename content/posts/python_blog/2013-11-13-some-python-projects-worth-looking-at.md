Hi there guys. So a lot has happened while I was away. It has been only a few weeks and a whole ton of great python project have emerged. In this post I will share a list of some of the excellent projects I saw in the past few days. So lets take a look at them without wasting any more time.<!--more-->

  * [Lans.py][1]

This project is interesting mostly for those who are into network security. This is a single script providing a set of useful commands. It is a packet parsing/injecting arp spoofer. Check out the github page for more information

  * [CherryMusic][2]

CherryMusic is not a new project but it recently got a new release. It is basically a music streaming server written in python. It allows you to stream your own music collection to all your devices! I have personally tested it and really recommend it.

  * [Python Wheels][3]

[Wheels][4] are [the new standard][5] of python distribution and are intended to replace eggs. Among other advantages, they offer faster installation and allow secure digital signing. This project does not support a lot of python packages at the moment but they are trying to support as many projects as possible.

  * [Dataset][6]

dataset provides two key functions that make using SQL databases in Python a breeze. A simple abstraction layer removes most direct SQL statements without the necessity for a full ORM model and Database contents can be exported (_frozen_) using a [_sophisticated plain file generator_][7]with JSON and CSV support.

  * [Openpyxl][8]

OpenPyxl is a Python library to read/write Excel 2007 xlsx/xlsm files. It was born from lack of existing library to read/write natively from Python the new Open Office XML format. Do check this project if you deal a lot with Excel files. You never know when you find something useful

If you are still reading then I guess you are hungry for more projects. Never mind I will do more posts about such things. For the time being do follow me on [twitter][9], follow this blog and comment below to share your views and to give me an idea about a future post.
