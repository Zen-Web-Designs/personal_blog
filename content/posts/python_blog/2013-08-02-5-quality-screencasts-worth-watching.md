Hello there fellas. I am back with another list of useful resources. This time i am going to share with you 5 quality python screen casts worth watching. Unlike ruby there are not really much quality screen casts related to python out there. So without wasting a dime lets continue with the list of those screen casts. So here it is:

- The first one if [Encoding Specifiers and Magical Mode Lines][1] in python. There's a lot in it for learning. Go check it out and you won't regret it.

- The second one is by Neck Beard Republic. This one is about [lambda functions in python][2]. Neck Beard Republic have great python screen casts but most of them are paid however they have some free screen casts as well.

- The third one is a series of screen casts by Kenneth Love. They are related to django. The title is [Getting Started With Django.][3] They are great. I have personally watched them. There's something for everyone in it. 

- The fourth one is again by Neckbeard Republic. This one is a must watch for every python programmer out there. The title of this screen cast is [`__dunder__` functions in python][4]. There can be alot of mystery involved in Python when it comes to the dunder (double underscore) methods. This screen cast will reveal the secret behind these function. However i have not personally watched it but it's on my todo list.

- Ah so now comes the last one. This one is again a Neckbeard Republic production. This one is about the `super()` literal in python. I can see how much effort [Mahdi Yusuf][5] has put into making these screen casts. 

So now we come to the end of another great post about 5 quality python screen casts worth watching. However there are some other video resources as well like [Showmedo][6] which i will cover in a future post. If you are feeling adventurous then check out [10 inspirations for your next python project][7] or [Packaging and distributing your python libraries][8]. I hope you liked today's post.
