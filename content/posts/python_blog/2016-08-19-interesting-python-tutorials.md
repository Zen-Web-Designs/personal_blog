Hi there folks! I have read some interesting Python tutorials lately. I would love to share them with you. Without any further ado let me list them over here:

**1. <a href="http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Composing Music With Recurrent Neural Networks</a>**

I loved this tutorial. It is a bit old but still worth a read. The author has explained the theory behind his implementation. You will enjoy this tutorial if you are interested in signal processing, machine learning and/or music.<!--more-->

**2. <a href="https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/15/page-dewarping.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page dewarping using OpenCV</a>**

This was an interesting read. I am not well versed in computer vision but still loved to read the theory behind the dewarping of an image of a curled page. The author does a great job at explaining the whole process and the algorithms used.

**3. <a href="http://www.discoversdk.com/blog/10-interesting-python-modules-to-learn-in-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Interesting Python Modules to learn in 2016</a>**

This is a good compilation of some of the famous Python libraries and modules. I have personally used almost all of them. I am linking this here because not only does this article lists the modules but because it also provides sample code for the specific module being discussed.

**4. <a href="https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern face recognition with Deep Learning</a>**

This article shows how modern face recognition works. The author takes you from isolating a face from an image to predicting which person does that face belong to. I learned a lot of new stuff from this tutorial. For instance, I had no idea what the HOG algorithm did before I read this tutorial.

**5. <a href="http://ahmedbesbes.com/how-to-score-08134-in-titanic-kaggle-challenge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to score 0.8134 in Titanic Kaggle Challenge</a>**

This was a highly informative read. I learned the basic workflow of a data scientist. The author does a great job of teaching you the basics of data science. He starts from exploratory data analysis of the data-set and ends with hyper parameter tuning of his predictive models.

I hope you will enjoy reading these articles. If there is anything you would like to ask me just know that I am only an email away. I reply to most of the emails I get. Even if you want to discuss any freelancing opportunity just hit me up. 

Till next time!
