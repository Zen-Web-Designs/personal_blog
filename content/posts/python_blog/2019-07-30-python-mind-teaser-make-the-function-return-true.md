Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹Â I was browsing [/r/python][1]Â and came across [this post][2]:

The challenge was easy. Provide such an input that if 1 is added to it, it is the instance of the same object but if 2 is added it is not.

## Solution 1: Custom class

The way I personally thought to solve this challenge was this:

```
def check(x):
    if x+1 is 1+x:
        return False
    if x+2 is not 2+x:
        return False
    return True

class Test(int):
    def __add__(self, v):
        if v == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return v

print(check(Test()))
# output: True
```

Let me explain how this works. In Python when we use the `+` operator Python calls a different dunder method depending on which side of the operator our object is. If our object is on the left side of the operator then `__add__` will be called, if it is on the right side then `__radd__` will be called.

Our Test object will return `0` if `Test() + 1` is called and `1` if `1 + Test()` is called. The trick is that we are overloading only one dunder method and keeping the other one same. This will help us pass the first if condition. If you take a second look at it you will see that it helps us pass the second if check as well because we simply return the input if it is not 1 so `Test() + 2` will always be similar to `2 + Test()`.

However, after reading the comments, I found another solution which did not require a custom class.

## Solution 2: A unique integer

User [/u/SethGecko11][3]Â came up with this absurdly short answer:

```
def check(x):
    if x+1 is 1+x:
        return False
    if x+2 is not 2+x:
        return False
    return True

print(check(-7))
# output: True
```

Only -7 works. Any other number will not return True. If you are confused as to why this works then you aren&#8217;t alone. I had to read the comments to figure out the reasoning.

So apparently, in Python, integers from -5 to 256 are pre-allocated. When you do any operation and the result falls within that range, you get the pre-allocated object. These are singletons so the `is` operator returns `True`. However, if you try using integers which don&#8217;t fall in this range, you get a new instance.

The memory requirement for pre-allocating these integers is not that high but apparently the performance gains are huge.

So when you use -7 as input, you get a new instance of -6 but the same instance when the answer is -5. This doesn&#8217;t work with the upper bound (256) precisely because of the way if statements are constructed. 255 would work as an answer if the check function was implemented like this:

```
def check(x):
    if x+1 is not 1+x:
        return False
    if x+2 is 2+x:
        return False
    return True
```

I hope you learned something new in this article. I don&#8217;t think you would ever have to use this in any code-base ever but it is a really good mind-teaser which can catch even seasoned Python developers off-guard.

Happy programming! I will see you in the next article ðŸ˜Š
