Hi there pythonistas. You might have noticed that I haven't been active much on this blog. There's a reason for that. I was preparing a PyCon talk. Yes I was really preparing a PyCon talk. The title of the talk is "Web Scraping in Python". I have submitted the proposal and now I am waiting for it's acceptance (or rejection). Do pray for it's acceptance and after that you will be able to see me in Montreal next year ðŸ˜‰. I will keep you guys updated.
