Hi there fellow programmers. I remember those days when i started learning python. I was always eager to find new blogs about python but found just a handful of them. This is one of the reason i started this blog. To spread my knowledge about python to other fellow coders. Today i am going to try to provide you 10 links to different python blogs that are worth following. By that i mean they are regularly updated and have useful info. So here's the list:

- The first one is [Planet python][1] undoubtedly one of the most famous python blogs out there. Go check it out. I hope you will find it helpful. It was last updated today.

- The second blog is [lucumr][2]. The home of the developer of flask (a python micro web framework).

- The third blog is [love-python][3]. I don't know how i stumbled over it but i really like this blog as it has a lot of useful info and code snippets.

- The fourth blog is of [Doug Hellmann][4]. He is the one behind PYMOTW (Python Module Of The Week). This blog covers a lot of python libraries. If you are searching for some new useful python libraries then go check this out.

- The next blog is [Coder Who Says Py][5]. It's a nice blog. Although it's not regularly updated but still you will find some helpful info in there.

- The sixth blog is [effbot][6]. Full of helpful info, code snippets and everything else you can expect from a python blog. Go check it out before it's too late.

- The seventh blog is of the writer of "Two Scoops Of Django". It is [pydanny][7]. This is mainly about django but still a lot can be learned from this blog. 

- The next [blog][8] is of Al Sweigat. He is the writer of numerous python books including his latest book "Hacking Secret Ciphers With Python". 

- The ninth blog is [this blog][9] on which you currently are. This is your all in one guide to python.

- The last blog is one of the most useful blog which got me up to speed with python. It is called [Mouse Vs Python][10]. 

I hope you liked today's post and i am sure i helped you out of your frustration of finding good python blogs. Do share your views in the comments below and if you think that i have missed a blog then put it in the comments as well.
