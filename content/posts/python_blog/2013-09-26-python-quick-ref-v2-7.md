Hi there everyone. We all have experienced that time when we say "what was that function called?", "was it called `get_attr()` or `post_attr()`?" Recently I came across a wonderful Python Quick Reference for version 2.7. It contains some useful information. I hope you will find it very useful just like me. 

So [here is the link](http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pqr2-7_printing_a4.pdf). Go forward and get it. You will not regret it. Do tell me in the comments that whether you like it or not or do you want something to be added to it. I would really love to hear your response. Let me make it clear as well that I am not the author of this great reference guide.
