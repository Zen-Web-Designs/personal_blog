🙌 Hopefully this will be the last update regarding my book for a while. It has been 2 years ⏱ since I self-published my "Intermediate Python" book 📖. In just a short span of 2 years I can not thank Allah enough for the level of success the book has achieved.

It has been translated into Chinese, Russian, Portuguese and Korean. A couple of days ago it hit the 🎉 🎉 520,000 readers mark 🎉🎉. Yes, you read that right! The book has been read by half a million people to date. This is just for the English version and I am pretty sure that Chinese version has been read by a lot more people.
  
The book has been opened in almost every part of the world at least once. The most rewarding experience is when you meet someone and they casually tell you how they came across your book online and actually learned something new from it.
  
Just wanted to thank each and every one of you who supported me. Do remember me in your prayers as I embark on new adventures. 🙂
  
I would also like to thank one very important person. This project wouldn't have been possible without the inspiration and support I got from Daniel Roy Greenfeld. He has been a great mentor and I can always rely on his wisdom whenever in doubt.
