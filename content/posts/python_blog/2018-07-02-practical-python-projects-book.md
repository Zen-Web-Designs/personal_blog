Hi everyone! I am super proud to announce that my second book 🎉🎉"**Practical Python Projects**"🎉🎉 is alhamdulillah almost halfway done content-wise. This book is a direct result of a market gap which I found when I started programming a couple of years back. Most programming beginners have access to multiple resources to teach themselves the basics of Python (or any other language) but they don't have access to those books/tutorials where they are taught to create end-to-end projects in a specific language. A fair amount of online tutorials and beginner textbooks teach the reader only the basics of a language without real-life concrete project development.
  
📨 Please sign up for my newsletter to get updates on the book (I send less than 2 emails per month): http://newsletter.pythontips.com/

Through my new book, you will be able to take your Python programming skills/knowledge to the next level by developing 15+ projects from scratch. These are bite-sized projects, meaning that you can implement each one of them during a weekend. These projects will not be just throwaway projects, you will actually be able to list them in your portfolio when applying for jobs.

## Current projects include:

👉 FIFA World Cup bot. You will learn how to send latest, upcoming and past match updates via SMS.

👉 Creating a Facebook & Soundcloud video/music downloader. You will learn how to log into Facebook and download private videos as well

👉 Making a Reddit + Facebook messenger bot. You will learn how the Facebook messenger bot system works. We will implement a fun chatbot which will send you jokes and motivational posts

👉 Controlling your system with Alexa. You will learn how to create an Alexa skill and use Facebook's image recognition API (we will reverse engineer it 😬) to recognize people in photos

👉 Scraping data from Steam. You will learn how to create automated data extraction software. We will focus on extracting data from Steam in this particular chapter.

👉 Article summary & Instagram stories upload. You will learn how to use state-of-the-art algorithms to generate 10 line (or more) summaries from online/offline articles. We will overlay these summaries over images extracted from online articles and then we will post these images to Instagram as stories.

👉 Cinema pre-show generator. You will learn video manipulation. Normally when you go to cinemas you see trailers for upcoming movies before the original movie starts. This project has a similar motive. Just provide it with a movie name and it will download trailers for 2 (or more) upcoming movies which have the same genre. It will then merge these trailers with a "put your cell phones on silent" msg and an iconic video countdown.

👉 Automatic Invoice generator. You will learn how to generate PDF invoices automatically. I will also teach you about task queues and how to make effective use of them. Lastly, you will learn how to implement email sending functionality in Python (Flask).

I have completed 🎉10 chapters 🎉 (each chapter == 1 project) amounting to almost 140 pages of content. It is already longer than my last book (yayy!!). I hope that inshAllah this book will be completed within the next couple of months.
  
~~Currently, I am looking for those beginner Python programmers who have recently learned this language to help me as beta testers. If you are one of them and would like to help by critiquing different chapters of the book please let me know.~~
  
**Edit:** I have enough people to help me with the beta testing right now. I will reach out to you guys when I am nearing completion. Do stay tuned for the publish announcement of the book!

If you have a project idea please share that with me as well. I am planning on making this the perfect book where you can learn about various different tools, packages, and techniques which might end up being useful at some point in your career.
  
P.S: The final book cover might be different from this one. If you have any suggestions please let me know 🙂

Have a great day! 💝
