I spend considerable time doing arts and creative projects. I used to do it as a hobby but now I am taking drawing and digital studio classes at Colgate University. We have been making a lot of interesting projects and have been trying to push the limits of creativity. Here are some of the projects I have done so far:

**:point_right: Living space drawing**

This was a part of my drawing class. We were supposed to draw a scene which was personal. I decided to draw a scene from my dorm room. I cleaned up the table and arranged the scene in a way to give the feel of an old-school jail room. I used an ebony pencil and a **30x40 (inch)** illustration board to do this drawing. The total drawing time was almost **20+ hours**. 

**:point_right: [Subverting a Website](/arts/A2)**

For this project I decided to subvert the Washington Post and showcase how there is a very thin line between real and fake news and sometimes it is hard to distinguish between the two. Open the [website](/arts/A2) and try it out for yourself. There is an autoplay audio. Firefox does not autoplay it so use Chrome to get the full experience.


I will update this page with new arts projects soon. :+1:
