I am currently taking a Digital Studio class at Colgate University by Margaretha. We have been making a lot of interesting projects and have been pushing the limits of creativity. 

**:point_right: [Subverting a Website](/arts/A2)**

![News website](/images/news.png)

For this project I decided to subvert the Washington Post and showcase how there is a very thin line between real and fake news and sometimes it is hard to distinguish between the two. Open the [website](/arts/A2) and try it out for yourself. There is an autoplay audio. Firefox does not autoplay it so use Chrome to get the full experience.


I will update this page with new arts projects soon. :+1:
