      <description>Hi everyone! I have been thinking about starting a blog on my personal website for quite a while now. Previously I just blogged on Python Tips. Even stuff which did not relate with Python found its way to Python Tips. I think some distinction is important. I always had to do some mental struggle to justify posting some non-python content on Python Tips.
Having this blog will surely mean that I will give even less time to Python Tips but it also means that I will be able to write more.</description>
