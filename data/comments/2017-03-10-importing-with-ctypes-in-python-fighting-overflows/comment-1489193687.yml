comment: "Note that there is no requirement for a 64 bit OS to define ints as 64 bit\
  \ wide.\n\nWhoever set an int to 0xf0f0f0f0 should review \xA75.2.4.2.1 of the C\
  \ standard - this is not going to work on all platforms, since the minimum INT_MAX\
  \ is only 65535.\n\nOne more note: you can avoid the step of inserting a print to\
  \ see why an assertion fails if you use a proper test case (an object derived from\
  \ unittest.TestCase) and then call self.assertEqual. This will automatically output\
  \ the values upon failure. Only some test runners will also do that for assert x\
  \ == y."
