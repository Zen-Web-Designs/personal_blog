comment: !!python/unicode 'Once upon a time there was a fantastic python miro community
  which is now defunct. It had tons of quality python-related videos, mostly from
  conferences. I am aware that you are talking about screencasts here but some conferences
  are screencast style. The sqlalchemy guys for example excel in this. It seems like
  it was repaced by a new pyvideo.org site.'
