comment: !!python/unicode 'I don''t think this is really ethical, the thing you''re
  doing. SoundCloud suffers as it is, it''s a very useful service which doesn''t have
  a particularly good business model, permanently on the verge of shutting down. When
  you teach people to reuse SC''s backend, it only serves to further damage the company
  (by driving the costs up), bringing closer the impending doom.


  I''d rather drain some other company''s resources, there are plenty of malvertising
  businesses out there with very deep pockets, such as Facebook, Google.


  Just my $0.05.'
