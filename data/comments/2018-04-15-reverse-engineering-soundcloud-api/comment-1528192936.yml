comment: !!python/unicode 'I am sorry I don''t really have any link handy. There are
  two ways you can go about doing this. First one is to create a browser extension
  and converting this Python code into Javascript code. The second one is to convert
  the python code into a Flask based API, run the API in the backend, create a browser
  extension which can pass a Soundcloud URL to the backend API and download the music
  from the url returned by the Flask API. I hope it helps :)'
