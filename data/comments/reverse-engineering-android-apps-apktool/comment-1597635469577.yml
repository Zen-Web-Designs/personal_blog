comment: "Hi Khalid,\r\n\r\nTheoretically you can but Smali isn't as easy as Java so you will have to put in a lot more effort than developing a simple app. If you want to add logging and do something super simple then Smali is fine but for anything more complex you will have to spend a lot of time with the Smali reference manual. Hope it helps :)"
