comment: "hi yasoob! am commenting to let you know how useful your tutorial has been to me, and am sure to many people as well.\r\ni ussually dont leave a comment once i have read an article. but with yours i felt it would be ungratefull on my part if i didnt thank you\r\nfor this wonderfull info. i hava so far decompiled one paid apk which am now using for free after succesfully modifying it and am in the\r\nprocess of modifying another. and throught the process i find myself coming back again and again to your article once i hit a rough spot.\r\n\r\nthanks again! keep the good work going we appriciate."
