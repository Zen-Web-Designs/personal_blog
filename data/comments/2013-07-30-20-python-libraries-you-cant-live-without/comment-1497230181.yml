comment: !!python/unicode 'I would replace NLTK with gensim, a wonderful package for
  text analytics. NLTK is good, but it is a bit old-school NLP, not to mention slow.
  The gensim package includes word2vec along with useful term vector reduction algorithm
  implementations. Significantly, critical parts of gensim that have been optimized
  with CPython.'
