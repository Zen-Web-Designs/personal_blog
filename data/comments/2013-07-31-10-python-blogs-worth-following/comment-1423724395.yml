comment: !!python/unicode "Hello,\nI am working on CrocToy project, which is a big\
  \ robotic toy with artificial intellect, a mix of an animal and a 3-4 years old\
  \ kid. After the research on possible main functionality, I decide to use Python\
  \ as a programming platform. I am looking for help in developing the entire architecture\
  \ or at least the main functionality modules:\n- text-to-speech synthesizer\n- voice\
  \ recognition\n- use xbox to maintain a \"vision\", simple object distancing and\
  \ recognition functions\n- use Python to move (program) servo motors\nHaving a limited\
  \ programming skills, I am looking for much of help or perhaps someone is interested\
  \ to get over of programming part of CrocToy's project. \nQuestion is how to let\
  \ know about my project to as many programmers as possible?\nIf it helps, I can\
  \ prepare a short overview of my project.\nThank you, sorry for imperfect English,\n\
  Andrew\nPS\nI may have troubles of follow answers to my post, please use my e-mail:\
  \ croctoy@gmail.com\nThank you,\nAndrew"
