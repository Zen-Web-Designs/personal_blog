comment: !!python/unicode 'Good post, but a couple of minor nitpicks: According to
  PEP8, there should be a space in  open(''file.txt'',''w'') . file is also not a
  good variable name, since it will (at least in Python 2) overshadow a built-in and
  therefore confuse people. Additionally, open(''file.txt'', ''w'') is virtually never
  the right thing to do since it involves a lot of guessing and can have crazy semantics
  on platforms. In &gt;99% of the cases, you either want to use io.open or open(''file'',
  ''wb'').'
