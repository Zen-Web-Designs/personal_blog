comment: !!python/unicode 'It''s a good book. I really enjoy reading the book. Something
  i think would be useful to readers are how to use some basic standard libs and applying
  into small projects like os, subprocess, just to name a few. Also since you talk
  about set, you may want to talk about list and dict since they''re basic data structures.
  also i can see unittest lib is also good since python is important for test development.'
