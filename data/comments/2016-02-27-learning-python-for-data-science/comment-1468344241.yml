comment: !!python/unicode 'Fantastic post! I use Python to do data science all the
  time. On the job and at home on pet projects. I love it. I love the flexibility
  it gives you. And well done on recommending Anaconda, it''s unbelievably useful
  for managing the scientific Python packages. Some; like Matplotlib Basemap can''t
  be pip installed, but are on Anaconda.


  Pandas is probably my favourite Python package! I wrote a tutorial on pandas on
  my blog (and numpy and matplotlib and basemap + more to come) you might want to
  check out too. http://www.datadependence.com/2016/05/scientific-python-pandas/'
