comment: !!python/unicode "Very nice compilation of learning resources. When it comes\
  \ to workspaces I think that one could mention the distribution Python(x, y) which\
  \ comes with the IDE Spyder. I would say that Spyder is quite similar to RStudio.\
  \ Of course, it does not look like RStudio in the way that Rodeo do. \n\nPycharm\
  \ is also a good, I think. \n\nAgain, thank you for a great compilation of resources."
