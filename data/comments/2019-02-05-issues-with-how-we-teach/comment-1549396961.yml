comment: !!python/unicode 'Hi Glenn!


  Thank you so much for that insight! I don''t know anything about Canada''s education
  system. It''s good to learn something new.


  Also, I am originally not from the States. I am from Pakistan :) I am sorry if it
  was confusing. I go to college in the states but my high school and all of the previous
  education was in Pakistan. Therefore, even though my criticism might be applicable
  to the states as well, I don''t have enough experience of US high school system
  to confirm that. Perhaps someone with more US high school experience can chime in
  here.


  Have a good day!'
