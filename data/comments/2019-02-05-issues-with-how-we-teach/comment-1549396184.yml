comment: !!python/unicode 'Great article Yasoob. I agree with your points but I did
  not experience what you did in your education. I live in the US but was educated
  in Canada. Canada is a large country with a small population. As a result it cannot
  afford to educate specialists (ie memorize just formulae, etc). They have to teach
  the reasons behind the formulae as people in the workforce have to do many jobs
  sometimes at the same time vs doing just one specialized job. The school year is
  much longer in Canada than in the US and I feel that also contributes to why we
  were taught the reasons behind the formalae not just to memorize them. With the
  short school year in the US there is just not the time to teach the background.

  Keep on the track you have set out for yourself. You are definitely going in the
  right direction.

  Good Luck.
