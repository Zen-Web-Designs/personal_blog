comment: !!python/unicode "Nicely explained.\nI am using\nwith open('database.txt','a+')\
  \ as myfile:\n            json.dump(lst,myfile)\nto write a list of integers called\
  \ ist in txt file. And it is in a loop, so it adds every time another list in the\
  \ file. I would like to make it to write every new list to a new line in file, but\
  \ don't know how to do that. Or insert ',' between everyblist in a file, so that\
  \ when I open the file for read, have readable list of lists for manipulation. How\
  \ can I do that?"
