comment: !!python/unicode 'By default, json.dump will output just a single line, so
  you''re already good to go. If you want just one large list, simply read in the
  file with json.load, overwrite it (with myfile.truncate()), and write your new list
  out. If you''re worried about data consistency, create a temporary file in the same
  directory, write into that, and then rename it to ''database.txt''.'
