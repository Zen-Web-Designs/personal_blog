comment: !!python/unicode 'if your object o is an object of a built-in class like
  str or list (say an email address "me@example.org"), import json;json.dumps(o) is
  literally everything you need. It sounds like your question would be better suited
  to stackoverflow. Feel free to drop me (phihag@phihag.de) a note about your stackoverflow
  question if it doesn''t get answered. Make sure to include all relevant details,
  including the definition of what you understand as a "class object" (that would
  be an object representing a class, which I don''t think you want) and "addresses"
  (postal? email? memory? inodes? IP?).'
