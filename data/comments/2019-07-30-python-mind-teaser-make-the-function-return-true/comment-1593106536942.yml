  Hi Yasoob! This was a super cool post. I love learning about the intricacies
  of Python. Quick question: Some of the comments on the reddit post said that
  the range of preallocated ints an implementation detail of the interpreter
  CPython, rather than a feature of Python itself. I'm wondering what strategy
  you use to partition elements of the language, the interpreter, and other
  parts I might not be familiar with -- or if it's colloquially acceptable to
  just bundle them all together. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
