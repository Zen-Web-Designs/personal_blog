comment: !!python/unicode 'No, Hamstagangsta, the "else: pass" is superfluous.  It''s
  presence is a matter of taste.


  Also, in the pretty print example, this would be (IMHO) more Pythonic:

  if i.isfile():

  . . . . files_loc.setdefault(i.dirname().basename(), []).append(i.basename())


  (Ignore leading dots; they''re just to ensure indentation.)  Essentially, there''s
  no need to check for the presence of  the key in files_loc first.  That''s the whole
  purpose of setdefault().'
