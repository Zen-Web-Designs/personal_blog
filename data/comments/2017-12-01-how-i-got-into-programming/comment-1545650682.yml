comment: !!python/unicode "Hi David!\n\nYou have already taken the first step and\
  \ are in way better shape than most! I am super excited to have you on this journey\
  \ with me. :) We both can and will do wonders. Just need to remember that learning\
  \ should never stop no matter what the age is. I loved this article about balancing\
  \ daily life and learning new skills along the way. You might find it interesting\
  \ to read https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-balance-full-time-work-with-creative-projects/\
  \ \n\nI would love to write more about the Deanonymization project in the future.\
  \ Keep on rocking and being a source of inspiration for everyone out there who believe\
  \ that you can't learn something new at 70. \n\nWould love to learn more about your\
  \ journey so far. You can send me an email at hi@yasoob.me I can't wait to hear\
  \ your story. Have a good day!"
