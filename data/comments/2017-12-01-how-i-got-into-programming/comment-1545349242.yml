comment: !!python/unicode 'Hi Yasoob, came across your site ''cause I''m learning
  Python. I identified with your story about a 13 year old from a 3rd world country
  wanting to learn programming. I''m over 70 which is also 3rd world country, if you
  see what I mean. We both have the capability, just need someone to take us seriously.

  So I''ve started learning Python, trying to build a portfolio of experience before
  I put myself on the market. My 1st project is lottery prediction, based on previous
  results, not expecting to make a big profit even if I get the results down from
  a few million to 1 in 500,000, but it''s good experience.

  Thanks for the inspiration, also like to hear more about your project Deanonymization
  &amp; Proximity Detection Using Wi-Fi  using Python.

  There must be so much untapped potential out there, maybe we should form a union
  Pensioners &amp; Young Pakistanis for PYthon Programming!'
