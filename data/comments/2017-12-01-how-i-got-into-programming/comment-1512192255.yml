comment: !!python/unicode 'Wow! You''re so inspirational. At 12, programming sounded
  like crazy smart rocket science stuff to me (and I was a nerd). Now, I''m falling
  in love with it. I''m happy for you and your accomplishments. Python is really far
  down on my bucket list, but I''m certain l''ll learn it one day.


  Oh, and what you said about females is sooooo true. I''m the Caribbean from what
  I''ve seen, males dominate the Computer Science field, and I don''t see much girls
  programming (unless they''re forced to in high school). I''m very much inspired
  by female programmers.'
