comment: !!python/unicode 'I am glad that you found it inspiring. And yeah I totally
  get the lack of female representation point. I personally try my best to have all
  of my events inviting for females. We all need to do a lot more to make this field
  more gender inclusive. I felt really sad after realizing that the initial programmers
  comprised of mainly women and that their representation diminished over time.'
