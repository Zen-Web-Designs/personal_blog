comment: !!python/unicode "The totalitarian tiptoe, as it's called, is a term used\
  \ to describe the way the Government goes; from a Republic made up of sovereign\
  \ individuals; to a Democracy empowered by the majorities mob rule; to a dictatorship\
  \ which crushes cherished freedom with unyielding terror. \n\nStep by step the government\
  \ will violate the people's rights until the people complain, the government will\
  \ back off waiting for complacency to sink in and then step again.\n\n Before you\
  \ know it you're born into a society that ignores its constitution, outsources their\
  \ monetary system to private bankers,  grandfathers are telling stories about  'the\
  \ good 'old days' to anyone polite enough to listen. \nInfaticly, this is not about\
  \ your government knowing your shopping habits. It is not about big corporations\
  \ kicking your data around like a soccer ball. It is about standing up to a government\
  \ that has fallen so far away from acceptable behavior within the scope of the limits\
  \ of its delegated powers and slowing down the erosion of the one thing which sets\
  \ us apart, our sense of liberty. \n\nIt's good to say no to the government when\
  \ they try to cross the line into my freedom. Tell the police 'no' you may not throw\
  \ my possessions onto the street when they ask if they can search your car. \nAsk\
  \ officials questions like; Who made you an authority; Why does this policy exist;\
  \ May I speak to whoever is in charge here?\n\nOtherwise, in its attempt to care\
  \ for everyone, the overzealous government will destroy anything that stands in\
  \ its way at any cost. The only way to mitigate the destruction is to be willing\
  \ to pay any price for your natural rights.\n\nAs one of my favorite people, Terrence\
  \ McKenna, once said: \"they don't hand out rights around here, the only people\
  \ who get any rights AT ALL, are the people who DEMAND them\".\n\nSo they are your\
  \ rights which others have already died to ensure, use them or lose them."
