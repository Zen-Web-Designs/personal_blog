comment: !!python/unicode 'A good tech talk thrives from structure. There is a limited
  number of points you can make, usually one. Split it into few subpoints (3-5, not
  more). Usually len(subpoints) &lt; len(slides), thus it is a good idea to start
  with the overall structure. If you are doing well, the most interesting stuff goes
  into subpoints[-1].'
