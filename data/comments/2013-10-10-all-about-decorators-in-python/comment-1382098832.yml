comment: !!python/unicode "def wrapped():\n            print ()\n            return\
  \ func()\n\nI think there shouldn't be a 'return'.\nIn the first a few listings,\
  \ 'func()' is a part of wrapper. But after the 'evil' part, 'func()' becomes a return\
  \ value of wrapper.\nIt confuses me and I believe it's a typo, isn't it?\nI am just\
  \ a beginner, correct me if I'm wrong, thanks."
