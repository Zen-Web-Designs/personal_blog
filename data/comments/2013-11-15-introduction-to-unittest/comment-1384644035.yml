comment: !!python/unicode 'Hi Yasoob!


  I really enjoy your blog. I came here not so long ago while searching for some info
  about decorators and I''ve subscribed immediately. I was very happy when I found
  out about PyCharm Community Edition - it was thanks to your blog! Now I have a great
  IDE to code with :)


  Keep up posting!


  P.S. My only wish is that your posts could be little longer ;)'
