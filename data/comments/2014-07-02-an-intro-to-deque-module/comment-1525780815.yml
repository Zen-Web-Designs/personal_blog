comment: !!python/unicode "Hi there, thanks for your write-up on this matter. All\
  \ your stuff is really helpful. \nNoob to python here. \n\nI'm assuming that deques\
  \ allow for string elements? Is there a way to force the container to accommodate\
  \ only integers for example?\n\nSecondly, if I wanted to insert double-digit numbers\
  \ into the list. My attempt has been unsuccessful - e.g. how do I return the element\
  \ '10' in the list?\n\n<pre><code>import collections\nt=collections.deque('12345678910')\n\
  print(t)\n\ndeque(['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '1', '0'])</code></pre>\n\nFinally,\
  \ what's the best way to sum the elements in the container? Would it be necessary\
  \ to loop through the list and sum iteratively?"
