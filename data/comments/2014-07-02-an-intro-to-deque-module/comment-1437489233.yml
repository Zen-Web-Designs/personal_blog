comment: !!python/unicode 'Okay, yes I too think that converting into a list and then
  inserting might not be a good idea . I thought insertion and deletion from a deque
  is less expensive than from a list but I suppose that''s only true if I insert/delete
  from the beginning or end. So maybe even the least computationally expensive way
  to insert into an arbitrary position would be by using a list. Anyway, thank you
  very much for your time.'
