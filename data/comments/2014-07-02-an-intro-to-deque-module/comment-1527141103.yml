comment: !!python/unicode "Hi David!\n\nI am assuming that when adding something to\
  \ the deque you can add a check for whether the item being added is an integer or\
  \ not. This is pretty easy by using the type() function. \n\nIn order to accommodate\
  \ 10 as well, you can initialise the deque like this:\n\n<pre><code>t=collections.deque([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])</code></pre>\n\
  \nAs far as summing the elements go, I would personally prefer to use a list comprehension\
  \ and the sum function like this:\n\n<pre><code>total = sum([int(elem) for elem in t])</code></pre>\n\n\
  In this case I am assuming that the deque might have integers in string form. If\
  \ you know for sure that the elements are all integers you can omit \"int\". \n\n\
  I hope my answer helps you. If you still have any questions please let me know!"
