comment: !!python/unicode 'No. As far as I know you can not do it. However, if that
  is really what you want to do then you can adopt a somewhat hacky way of first converting
  it into a list, inserting the element in an arbitrary position and then casting
  it back into a deque. But I would not recommend that.'
