comment: !!python/unicode "Wow, great post indeed. But I had to remove the last part\
  \ of the code              `\"stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)\"` for it to work. If I had\
  \ it in, it generated the error:\n<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"abc.py\"\
  , line 14, in \nstderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)</code></pre>\nMy knowledge of programming is very\
  \ limited, but it's exciting that it actually worked. I'll try to follow the whole\
  \ procedure this weekend to find out how it actually works, but very interesting\
  \ nonetheless, site favorited."
