  I'm a fan of Yasoob's work. His previous work 'Intermediate Python' has helped
  me enormously in my Python career so far, so it was a no brainer to purchase
  his latest book 'Practical Python Projects'. On first inspection, this looks
  like a very thorough, and modern treatment of how to create projects, and I
  look forward to coming up with my own projects spawned from ideas in this
  book. The book is well illustrated, and the code examples easy to follow. If I
  could make one suggestion of something that is perhaps missing, it would be
  that this book doesn't cover off the last mile of source control and setting
  up projects on GitHub with a readme.md & licencing, requirements files, etc,
  and nor does it cover testing of the projects. Having said that, if you're
  stuck for project ideas, this book is for you! I can easily recommend A+++.
