comment: !!python/unicode 'Curious that you''re mentioning ast.literal_eval without
  any reason. It''s actually a much more limited eval and is not designed to evaluate
  general Python. The ast module is for modeling Python''s syntax. Try a few statements
  with literal_eval; you will not get far.'
