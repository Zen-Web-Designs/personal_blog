comment: !!python/unicode 'I have a little experience with "sortedcontainers" module,
  but what I''ve noticed is that it causes reference cycles (zombie object) which
  are collected by GC (if it is not disabled) and it leads to latency spikes. Be careful
  with it if latency and/or performance matters for you.'
