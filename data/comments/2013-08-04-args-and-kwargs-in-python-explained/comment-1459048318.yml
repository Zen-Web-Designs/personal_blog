comment: !!python/unicode 'When using **kwargs, we call those ''keyword'' arguments.

  But in Python, I thought ''keyword'' referred to Python keywords like ''if'', ''else'',
  ''while'', ''for'', etc.

  I''m guessing the term ''keyword'' means two completely different things depending
  on the context (Python language keywords vs. keyword arguments) but I wasn''t sure,
  can someone clarify?'
