comment: !!python/unicode 'Thank you!  It''s the best explanation I''ve read but I
  don''t really see the point in them.


  In PHP we just pass variables onto functions.  A variable can be well... anything.  A
  number, a string, an array or even a multidimensional array - can all be handled
  by just saying:


  function hello($some_variable) {

  //do some stuff

  }


  In PHP the function doesn''t really care what gets passed to it.  Whether you through
  into the function, PHP will deal with it.  So, if PHP is able to live quite happily
  without args and kwargs, how come Python seems to have a problem here?


  This is not a loaded question.  It''s a sincere question from a dude who is trying
  to learn.  Perhaps I''m missing something.


  Many thanks,
