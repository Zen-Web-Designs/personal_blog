  Python functions really doesn''t care about what you pass to them.

  But you got it the wrong way... please re-read the post.

  If you want to pass one thousand arguments to your function, then you can''t explicitly
  define every parameter in your function definition. For the reason you will use
  *args and your function will be automagically able to handle all the arguments you
  pass to them for you.'
