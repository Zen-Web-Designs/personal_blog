comment: !!python/unicode "In the second paragraph, you've said:\n\n\"*args is used\
  \ to send a non-keyworded variable length argument list to the function\".\n\nAs\
  \ far as I understand, what you're passing is any number of non-keyworded arguments\
  \ in the function call. But NOT in a list. Am I wrong? \n\nThanks for the article\
