comment: !!python/unicode 'For Python3 now please note a difference:

  in the first example for usage of **kwargs the line that has this:

  for key, value in kwargs.iteritems():


  gave me an error because it needs to be:

  for key, value in kwargs.items():


  since iteritems() no longer is defined in Python3 because items() can do the same
  thing.'
