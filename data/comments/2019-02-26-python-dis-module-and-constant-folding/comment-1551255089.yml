comment: !!python/unicode "Great article!  \n\nIf you look at what might be the PR\
  \ that brought some of this constant folding into Py3 : https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/2858/files#diff-807cb08857a345ecb5c5665366c642d5R200\
  \ (about line 200 of Python/ast_opt.c), you'll see it was limiting things to numbers\
  \ that were smaller than 20 digits.  I suspect this got upped as 3xx64 is 30 digits\
  \ while 3xx65 is 31."
