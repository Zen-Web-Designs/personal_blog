comment: !!python/unicode 'Yes. It all depends on what the button is doing. Is it
  executing some JavaScript? If yes, then you need to see what the JavaScript is actually
  doing and if you can implement the logic in Python. If it is simply a button to
  a different url, you can extract the url using regex and use requests or scrapy
  to open it. I hope it helps :)'
