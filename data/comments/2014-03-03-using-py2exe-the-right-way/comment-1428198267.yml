comment: !!python/unicode 'Using PyQt4 / Python 3.4, and wanting a single executable
  (not a folder of files), I think that limits me to using py2exe instead of some
  of the other newbie-friendly gui-based tools (cx_freeze , pyInstaller, etc).


  Unfortunately, while my .py file runs fine when I execute it in tge IDLE GUI, it
  doesn''t run from the console due to  ''no module named xxxx'' errors.


  I assume I have to get that to work first before running py2exe... but what makes
  it work from the IDLE gui and not via a command prompt?'
