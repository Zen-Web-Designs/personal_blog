comment: !!python/unicode 'For some reason I''m still getting the Missing Sip error
  even though I''ve called for it in my setup.py script. I''m also running it in the
  command line as "python setup.py py2exe" but when I run the exe I still get that
  error. However, running the command "python setup.py py2exe --includes sip compiles
  the project just fine. The only problem: I''m missing more modules and don''t know
  how to list multiple modules other than in the setup.py file. Please help?'
