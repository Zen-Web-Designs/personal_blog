comment: !!python/unicode "Hi\nI have been using py2exe for some time and I too have\
  \ had similar problems but I managed to solve them, but right now I am really stuck\
  \ on one that I can't fix. The thing is that I must use gnuradio.wxgui for the app\
  \ I am currently developing, instead of PyQt which is what I have always used. For\
  \ PyQt I include \"PyQt4.QtGui\" and \"PyQt4.QtCore\" in the setup.py because I\
  \ always use these modules, without them a can't build the exe. But now for the\
  \ gnuradio.wxgui app I don't know what happens that I manage to build the exe and\
  \ when I run it, it shows up but it doesn't respond, it just freezes, nothing happens\
  \ and any click on the app causes it to close. I was wondering if there was any\
  \ special module that must be included as in the PyQt case. If you happen to know\
  \ what is causing this I would really appreciate your help.                    \
  \                                  \nThank you so much\n Sergio Frayle"
