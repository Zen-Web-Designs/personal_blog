comment: !!python/unicode "Hi Yassob,\nYou're first point caught my eye as I ran into\
  \ that a few years back.  I had found a relatively good answer at \"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12965238/wxpython-py2exe-app-not-bundling-properly\"\
  \n\nIn any case, adding 'MSVCP90.dll' to the excludes appears to have worked in\
  \ my case. \n\nPY2EXE (or CXFreeze) all seem to be hit and miss at times and gathering\
  \ from all the forum chatter, needs a lot of tweaking at time. \nOther issues I\
  \ ran into: Ex. the vlc binding might not py2exe properly work depending on the\
  \ vlc.py and python versions you are trying, then furthermore it may or may not\
  \ py2exe properly depending on the bundle option.\nCurrently also having problems\
  \ trying to py2exe an app that uses pysnmp (4.2.5 and/or 4.3) . \n\nAnyways I hope\
  \ the posting on \"wxpython-py2exe-app-not-bundling-properly\" may help explain\
  \ a few things."
