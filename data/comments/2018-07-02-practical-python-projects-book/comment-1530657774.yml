comment: !!python/unicode "Hello Yasoob!\n I stumbled onto your channel thanks to\
  \ your tutorial on how to open an image file in Python. Thanks for these great tutorials.\
  \ \n\nThis book is exactly what I am looking for.  I started learning Python on\
  \ my own about 3 weeks ago and I would like to believe that I understand a lot of\
  \ the basic functionality now. I feel that I am at a point where I can take on actual\
  \ projects and the ones you have mentioned here sound incredible as they cover a\
  \ wide range of very relevant topics.  If there's a spot still available, I would\
  \ love to help with the beta testing."
