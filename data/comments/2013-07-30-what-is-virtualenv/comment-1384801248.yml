comment: !!python/unicode 'You should also check-out a project called zc.buildout.
  It''s similar to virtualenv but creates a Python environment sandbox in the directory
  where your project lives, and is based off "recipes" which can do things virtualenv
  can''t, building and installing non-python binaries locally (eg. libxml2). It''s
  very useful when you have a number of devs working on the same project across multiple
  systems, and makes deployment a breeze.'
