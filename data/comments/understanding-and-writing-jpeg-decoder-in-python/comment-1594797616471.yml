comment: "Beautiful deobfuscation  of some basic image format exchange expressed pragmatically using complicated c structs in a language python agrees with. \r\n\r\nI'm still trying to t odigest it, but I find myself understanding struct packing better with pieces like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nheader, = struct.unpack('B', data[offset:offset+1])\r\noffset = offset + 1\r\n```  \r\n\r\nI'd be __nice__ to accomplish the same with bytesarray,  but i'm still trying to figure out scalar types."
