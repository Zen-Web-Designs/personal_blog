  I remember a launch years ago that aborted just before ignition. Walter
  Cronkite asked someone what happened and they told him that there were three
  computers and they vote. If not in agreement, the action does not occur. A few
  hours later the launch went off. Cronkite went back and asked what had they
  done. The answer buried in a lot of techno bable was that they rebooted the
  computer that voted no.
