  I was working with Qt in a previous job and in my ramp up of it discovered
  that SpaceX was using QML for the Crew Dragon UI. I believe that jives with
  the statement that "only the graphics are drawn with JS/Chromium" and that the
  rest of the code is C++. Really awesome how far UI development has come with
  balancing high performance vs speed of development vs visual quality!
