comment: !!python/unicode 'Thanks for this great post. You may also consider www.ansible.com
  for Deployment, provisioning, orchestration, ...

  You can install it easily just with pip and it makes your life thousand time nicer.

  I used Fabric and done deployment. It''s fine for the beginning and maybe mini projects,
  but Ansible is just awesome for any sized project and is really easy to learn and
  work with.


  P.S.: I use Ansible+Vagrant (www.vagrantup.com) to create and configure deployment
  environments.'
