comment: !!python/unicode 'Hey Andrew,


  I am sorry but I forgot to include the table creation part in the post. I have edited
  the post to rectify that. Basically you need to do the following after uploading
  the final code on Heroku:
  
  <pre><code>
  $ heroku run python
  </code></pre>

  In the resulting python shell run the following commands:

  <pre><code>
  >>> from app import db

  >>> db.create_all()
  </code></pre>

  Then close the shell and things should start working as expected. If something still
  doesn''t work please let me know :)'
