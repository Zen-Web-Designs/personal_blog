comment: !!python/unicode 'Hi, great post! It saved me some time writing my own Twitter
  bot. A couple things:


  1) Can you please post this code to www.github.com as a code repository with a license?
  As-is, without a license, we legally cannot use, modify, nor share your code. The
  added advantage to putting it on GitHub is that we can contribute code to this bot
  in the future and make it better for everyone.


  2) I have a bug fix to suggest. Currently in the function tweet_creator(subreddit_info),
  the bot gathers all the IDs to tweet, gets the goo.gl shortlink, then later down
  the pipeline checks if the ID has already been tweeted. This is inefficient on multiple
  levels, but also bad because it generates goo.gl shortlinks for posts that may end
  up not getting submitted (if the bot has already submitted them). As a fix, I suggest
  moving the duplicate check code up to the for loop that originally gathers the submissions
  in tweet_creator(subreddit_info).


  Cheers,


  r'
