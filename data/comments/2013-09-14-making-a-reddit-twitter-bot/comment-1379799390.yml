comment: !!python/unicode 'Hi there Alekz.p. Thanks for replying. The problem is that
  this blog is currently on wordpress. I can only use gist to use syntax highlighting
  but by embedding gist in the current theme the code font becomes TOO big so I left
  it. I don''t want to change the theme because there is no other free good looking
  theme like this. In near future I am going to shift it to python preferably Pelican.
  Lets see what becomes of this blog in the future.'
