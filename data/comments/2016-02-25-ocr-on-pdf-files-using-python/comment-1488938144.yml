comment: !!python/unicode 'Hi,


  I am attempting to get this code to work with various PDFs that I have that have
  been OCR''d from printed documents.  I am running on Mac OSX El Capitan with the
  latest tesseract installed via Homebrew.


  I am running it in a Python 2.7.11 environment


  My issue is that when I run a PDF document through this procedure it does not generate
  any text.  It is always blank.


  What might be causing this?'
