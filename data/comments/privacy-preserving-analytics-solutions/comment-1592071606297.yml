comment: "Good list, and really nice that privacy seems to be on a upward trend recently!\r\n\r\nOne thing that that could be mentioned is that there is a step even further, by self-hosting your analytics dashboards. For example. the article could have also included self-hosted alternatives, like Matomo. I'm also working on a [cheaper alternative to Matomo called userTrack](https://www.userTrack.net), which might also be useful for the slightly more technical users who know how to setup their own web server."
