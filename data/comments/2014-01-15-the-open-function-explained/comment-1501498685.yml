comment: !!python/unicode "<pre><code>CONTENT = r\"C:\\Users\\CHARLES\\Desktop\\test.txt\"\n\
  D = open(CONTENT,'r').read()\nprint(type(D))\nopen(CONTENT,'r').close()</code></pre>\n\nIf you\
  \ see the second line without the \".read()\" the result will feed the object D,\
  \ so that you can use D with `.close()` or `.read()`, however, I am putting .read()\
  \ right next to the open() cause it will catch the information that will be saved\
  \ in D as an object and instead of having D as an object a am turning this info\
  \ into a string. \nYou can test it with the following;\nprint(type(D))"
