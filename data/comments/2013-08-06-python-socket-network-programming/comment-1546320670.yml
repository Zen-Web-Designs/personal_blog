comment: !!python/unicode "Nice set of tutorial. I like how you explain these topic\
  \ using common language and terms, You to do not assume that the reader knows technical\
  \ terms. When basically takes away that whole purpose of a beginner`s tutorial.\
  \ I would suggest that next you do one on \n#1 Factories\n#2 Generators\n#3 Iterators\n\
  #4 Tuples\n#5 Sequences\n#6 List\n\nThose are topics ( in the of least understood\
  \ to somewhat understood) that have baffled me in the 16 years that I have been\
  \ dabbling in python."
