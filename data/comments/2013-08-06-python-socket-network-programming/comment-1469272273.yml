comment: !!python/unicode 'I am trying to connect linux machines via telnet. I am
  able to connect to it and execute the commands (For Ex: "ls"), but I am not able
  to get the output of "ls" when I try to print it. Using exit I am closing the connection,
  then only I am able to read all the contents and print on my console.


  Can anyone please tel me, how can I fetch the results without closing the connection
  and execute more commands by using same telnet connection.'
