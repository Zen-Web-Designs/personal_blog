comment: !!python/unicode 'Great blog you put up. Very informative. However id like
  to ask you about something else. Is it possible to apply that to two different computers
  ex connected in LAN. Would it be possible to run a server script and a client script
  in a server pc and client pc, respectively? And also id like to know if its possible
  to check if a certain pc is connected to a network or now by any python networking
  scripts? Thank you for your patience in reading this. Let me know about your answer'
