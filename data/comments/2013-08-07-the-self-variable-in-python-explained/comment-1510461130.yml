comment: !!python/unicode 'Mmm, fellas is definitely not gender neutral but I have
  no doubt it wasnt your intention to specifically exclude females in the conversation.
  Especially with the recent issues highlighting some horrible attitudes towards women
  in the industry, we should be making an effort to be more inclusive. Something like
  this may seem minor,  but on the other hand it''s a minor thing to just not use
  gender specific words. I am certainly guilty of unconscious bias myself, and using
  terms like "hey guys" (very similar!). My boss (male) actually called me out on
  that once, and it made me think "yeah, actually, good point!" and I try not to use
  it now...at least not in professional life anyway. People don''t like being told
  they''re being offensive when they didn''t mean anything by it. It''s very irritating
  to some, and seems very unfair to them. But we shouldn''t be defensive and just
  dismiss it as "political correctness" (as if somehow being correct is a bad thing),
  we should be bigger than that, not take it personally, and just make a little bit
  of effort to be inclusive. It takes a lot less energy :) This is more a general
  comment than a criticism towards you yasoob: I can assume you are sincere in not
  wanting to cause offense. But i would''ve personally just replied with "Oopse good
  point! Sorry, I''ll change it". Why not? :)'
