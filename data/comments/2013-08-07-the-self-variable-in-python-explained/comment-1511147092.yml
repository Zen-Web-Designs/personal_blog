comment: !!python/unicode 'Once x becomes bound to the Restaurant class, x.bankrupt
  is just the data attribute that stores whether x is bankrupt or not. Try calling
  the class method, x.open_branch(), to have the code check x.bankrupt and then print
  accordingly. For reference, https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#instance-objects'
