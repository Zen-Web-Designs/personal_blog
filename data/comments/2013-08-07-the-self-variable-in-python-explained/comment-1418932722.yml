comment: "Shouldn't the \"open_branch\" function's if-statement say,\n\nif self.bankrupt\
  \ == True:\n    print (\"branch opened\")\n\nBecause you said, \n\n\"Then we assign\
  \ it a property \u201Cbankrupt\u201D which is currently false. ***After that we\
  \ assign it a function open_branch which can only occur if \u201Cbankrupt\u201D\
  \ is False which means that the Restaurant has some money.***\""
