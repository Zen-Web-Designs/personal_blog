  \ I meant to correct.\n\nI mean shouldn't the if-statement say,\n\nif self.bankrupt\
  \ == False:\n    print(\"branch opened\")\n\nThis is to make the idea of your class\
  \ make more sense? \n\nIf a restaurant IS BANKRUPT, that means bankrupt = True.\
  \ \n\nWhy would the branch be opened then if it IS bankrupt?"
