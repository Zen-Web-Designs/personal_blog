comment: !!python/unicode "Thanks you for very nice explanation. Could you please\
  \ elaborate on object parameter which is present while declaring a class.. What\
  \ is its significance? Also do we need to explicitly declare class variables ?\n\
  I mean is below code is correct?\nclass Restaurant(object):\n   def __init__(self):\n\
  \      self.bankrupt = false;\n    def open_branch(self):\n        if not self.bankrupt:\n\
  \            print(\"branch opened\")"
