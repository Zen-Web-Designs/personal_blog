comment: !!python/unicode 'Thanks for sharing this. This post inspired me to make
  my own attempt as a sudoku solver. I wrote my code before looking at this so I was
  surprised to see how short this code is. The solution is very elegant however it
  relies a lot on recursion so it''s a bit time-intensive.'
