comment: !!python/unicode "Daniel, \nI tried this and the code works. You can copy-paste\
  \ this into a python editor and save it, then run it. When you call it, you need\
  \ to include an 81 character string on the command line. This string represents\
  \ the sudoku puzzle, with 0's in place of the empty cells. So you'd call it like\
  \ this:\n     python sudoku.py 81-char-string\n\nAlternatively, I modified the script\
  \ and included it on my GitHub account. My version takes a filename as input on\
  \ the command line. The file contains the sudoku puzzle. Each line in the file represents\
  \ one row in the puzzle, with 0's in the empty cells. You can find the code here\
  \ - https://github.com/ariesunique/sudoku. The txt files are the puzzles. The file\
  \ called simple_sudoku_solver.py is the code found on this page."
