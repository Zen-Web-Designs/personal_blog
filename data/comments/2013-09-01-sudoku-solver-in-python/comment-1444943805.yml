comment: !!python/unicode 'Where exactly did you find this and can you provide an
  explanation of how it works? I''m not interested in using the code; I just want
  to understand and learn from it. When I want a program to solve a common problem
  or puzzle, I usually just write one myself, assuming it''s not too complicated.
  If I really need the program and can''t figure out how to write it myself, and then,
  and only then, will I rely on someone else''s code'
