comment: !!python/unicode 'Hi MIKHAIL. Firstly thanx for replying and secondly I have
  not used count=100 in a condition. I have used it in a function. I could have written
  "def search_tweets(q, count)" but there can be a problem with that. If we don''t
  pass a value for count our function will give an error. I have set a default value
  of 100 so that if I don''t pass a value for count my function will take count to
  be equal to 100. I hope that clarifies everything. Still if you have any other question
  then feel free to post.'
