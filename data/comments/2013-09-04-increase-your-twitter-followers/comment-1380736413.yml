comment: !!python/unicode "It will be in Ukrainian language. I can change words myself,\
  \ I just wanna sample, because I just started to learn Python few month ago, but\
  \ it's difficult to me to work with twitter api :]\nIt will be autoresponder bot,\
  \ that wishes something. \n\nI know about API limit. Nearly 1000 twits\n\nAlso,\
  \ have two suggestions for you:\n1. Make auto-reply bot that launch automatically.\
  \ For example, once in 5 minutes. \n2. Select reply-phrase from some range of phrases\
  \ (for example: we have three reply-phrases in a range: \"Me too!\", \"I love it\
  \ soooo much\" and \"Python - forever!\". When someone post a twit with a word \"\
  Python\" in it - bot replies with a random selected phrase from our range)"
