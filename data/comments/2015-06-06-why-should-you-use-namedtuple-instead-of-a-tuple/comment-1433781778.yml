comment: !!python/unicode "Thank for a nice post.\nI'd have a follow up question -\
  \ how easy it is to create a named tuple from a dictionary (with default values\
  \ for example)? I have my workarounds but thought you may know better.\n\nMy use\
  \ case is as follows: I'm using argparse library in my code. Unfortunately (!) \
  \ they use named tuples too. All is well when I call my code through command line\
  \ (all parameters are set and used in the code), but sometimes I want to use my\
  \ code not through the command line. So what I want to do is to set just a few parameters\
  \ in the named tuple and pass it along to the logic. Unfortunately it's impossible\
  \ - all parameters need to be set (even when not used in my logic).\n\nSo what I\
  \ ended up doing is either expecting a dictionary or converting named tuple to a\
  \ dictionary and then process. This ain't elegant though in my view.\n\nWould prefer\
  \ argparse to use dictionaries... \n\nAny hints are appreciated. \n\nThank you,\
  \ \nPaul"
