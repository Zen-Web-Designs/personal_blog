comment: !!python/unicode 'I am currently working on a database management project
  using Tkinter with Python 3 &amp; Sqlite. I am new to Python but a fast learner,
  and am looking for samples of well-designed Tkinter applications to help me do my
  project the right way.  It looks like the examples in this book would be perfect
  for me.'
