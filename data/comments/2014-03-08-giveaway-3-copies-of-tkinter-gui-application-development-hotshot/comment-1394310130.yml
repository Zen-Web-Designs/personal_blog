comment: !!python/unicode 'Just a note first - your link to the book''s page has an
  unnecessary space in it. It should be http://www.packtpub.com/tkinter-gui-application-development-hotshot/book


  Learning to write multi-threaded applications is probably what interests me the
  most about this. While making a note-taking program for an Extended Project Qualification,
  I''ve been occasionally working on a 2D terrain generator. The basic generation
  works, but I''m looking to add more complexity. The generation is pretty fast, but
  the ways I''m displaying it in tkinter make it pretty slow, so any good practices
  I can apply to the code would be helpful.'
