comment: !!python/unicode 'Sometimes the CLI just won''t do. Sometimes I want to distribute
  my programs to friends; not all of than are capable of using the terminal. This
  book seems to be full of good ideas on how to write useable, maintainable, practical
  object oriented applications in python/tkinter. I am really interested in this book.
