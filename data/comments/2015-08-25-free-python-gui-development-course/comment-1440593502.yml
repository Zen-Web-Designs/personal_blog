comment: !!python/unicode "Hello, Yasoob. Thank you so much firstly for doing this,\
  \ you're lighting 100 more candles by your flame. \nI am a 5th year undergrad from\
  \ India who wants to fill around 15 of his python scripts with some sort of GUI\
  \ so they become more user-friendly. I was going through different sources for learning\
  \ GUI with python, and after going through the course structure realized that this\
  \ course would be like a jackpot. Let me know if I can receive a coupon as well.\
  \ \nThank you."
