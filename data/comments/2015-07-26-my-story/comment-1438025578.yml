comment: !!python/unicode 'Hey that is great! I would recommend Flask but it is solely
  my own preference. If you believe that you can easily learn the "magic" going on
  behind the scenes in Django then Django is also not a bad choice. However, I know
  a couple of companies who have/are migrating from Django to Flask because of the
  flexibility Flask provides. In the end it is up to you. There are a lot of comparisons
  done between both of these frameworks by a lot of people online so I wont be doing
  it again. I hope that I have answered your question. If there is anything else which
  you would like to ask then just let me know and I would be happy to assist you.
