comment: !!python/unicode 'Hello! I stumbled across your site a few days ago and it''s
  been very useful. I added you to the Links page on my techie blog, Let''s Go Larval,
  so more people can find you.


  First, a little off topic: Your booklist appears to be missing Head First Python
  (which you said you learned from). You also appear not to have run across <i>Creating
  Apps in Kivy</i>, which is O''Reilly''s Kivy book. It''s a really nice one. There
  seem to be two classes of programming books: ones written by dispassionate Microsoft
  (or whatever big tech company) bureaucrats, and ones written by hackers who actually
  like the language. CAiK is one of the latter, of course.


  My first programming experience was about age 12, too. I was messing around with
  RPG Maker XP mostly because of a game called Aveyond, rather than with VB because
  of Club Penguin. Funny how that sort of experience can be so similar.


  Anyway, I''m just posting because I know how nice it is to get comments. It''s fun
  to see what people have to say back to you. Oh, and yes, I''m a geek girl :)


  Something interesting about taking programming classes as a girl is that you''re
  usually 1 girl among 19 guys, and it seems (around here at least) that the only
  guys who are actually malicious are adults. It sucks when they''re teachers. I had
  to deal with that last year; the school officials didn''t believe me when I said
  that the teacher was subtly, persistently ragging on me every day, but apparently
  since then he said something dumb to the wrong person; he isn''t working there any
  more and my advisor is being extra nice to me all of a sudden. Suits me just fine--I
  was having a hard time avoiding scheduling his classes again because they weren''t
  taking me seriously.


  Fortunately, these jerks seem to be even less common than girls. Most guys aren''t
  like that. They even say thank you if I fix the bug they''ve been struggling with
  for the past 20 minutes, which is not something you get from someone who feels their
  masculinity is challenged by a lady coding more neatly than they do. ;)


  Oh, one more thing. If you like my cute penguin icon and you have a use for a cute
  penguin image, you can find him (and a few others of varying graphic neatness) on
  my Open Art page.

  Happy hacking!'
