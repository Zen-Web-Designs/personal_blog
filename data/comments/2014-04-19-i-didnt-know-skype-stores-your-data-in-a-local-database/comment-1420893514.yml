comment: !!python/unicode "Well you log into Skype using a password, so Skype could\
  \ have used that password to encrypt the message contents.  It gets more tricky\
  \ when you change your password but its still possible.\n\nBut if you give someone\
  \ access to your PC then you really can't complain about security.  It's no different\
  \ to giving someone keys to your house.  \n\nThe comment about company laptops is\
  \ also moot.  If this is a company machine, then anything stored on it is company\
  \ owned.  If you don't want your boss reading your personal skype chats, then don't\
  \ use a company machine to do it on!"
