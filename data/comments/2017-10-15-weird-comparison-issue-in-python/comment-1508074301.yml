comment: !!python/unicode 'Yes, that''s the downside of chained comparisons. As a
  general rule of thumb, you should use parentheses whenever you are not 100% sure:
  Even if your code was right already, parentheses make it much more easier to read
  for people who are less experienced than you.


  By the way, don''t you mean that y is only evaluated once?'
