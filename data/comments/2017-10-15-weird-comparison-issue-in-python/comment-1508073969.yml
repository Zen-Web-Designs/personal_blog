comment: !!python/unicode 'first of all, cool post. once it is known how python handles
  this, the obvious workaround (use parentheses to force python to handle things in
  the order we prefer) is:


  (d + 2 * a &gt; int(c)) == b


  and that fixes your problem. now if you want to tell me that pythons way of handling
  d + 2 * a &gt; int(c) == b is weird and un-obvious: i agree. i wouldnt have guessed
  that (d + 2 * a &gt; int(c)) == b fixes it until i read your post. but at least
  the fix is easy and intuitive-- once the piece of knowledge youre sharing here is
  known.'
