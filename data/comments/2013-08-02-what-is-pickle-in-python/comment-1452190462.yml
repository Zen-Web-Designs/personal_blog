comment: !!python/unicode 'Yasoob, nice work! I ran your example on python3 and wanted
  to point out to your readers a minor change for python3 compatibility. Python3 requires
  an encoding parameter to the open method for reading binary files. The line "b =
  pickle.load(fileObject)" will raise an exception unless "fileObject = open(file_Name,''r'')"
  is changed to "fileObject = open(file_Name,''rb'').'
