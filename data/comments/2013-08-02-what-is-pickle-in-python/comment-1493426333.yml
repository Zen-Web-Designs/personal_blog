comment: !!python/unicode "My friend, thanks for sharing. However if u load pickle\
  \ u need to open file as 'rb' mode also, otherwise it will not work. \nSo add to:\
  \ fileObject = open(file_Name,'r')  ---&gt; fileObject = open(file_Name,'rb')\n\
  [Notice 'rb' in mode] :)\nYou explained it well, good job. Take care"
