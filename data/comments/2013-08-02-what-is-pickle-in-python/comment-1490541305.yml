comment: !!python/unicode 'While loading the pickled object back, the file should
  be opened in "rb" mode instead of just ''r'' since we have dumped initially by writing
  in raw binary "wb" mode. If not done, this throws the error (UnicodeDecodeError:
  ''utf-8'' codec can''t decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte).'
