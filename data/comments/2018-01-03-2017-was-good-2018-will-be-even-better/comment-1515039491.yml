comment: !!python/unicode "Got it. Here's mine for 2017: \n- Changed (full-time) jobs\
  \ to a Cloud Computing company as a Project Manager; had never been involved with\
  \ Cloud before. Learnt heaps.\n- Commenced BA of Computer Science (part-time) included\
  \ programming in Python (I'm 55). Got a couple of HD's!  :)\n- Moved back to Australia\
  \ after working 2 years in Austin, TX. (Visit Australia, you'll love it).\nStill\
  \ putting my 2018 list together - a mind map helped. Data Science and more mathematics\
  \ for study this year. \nVery inspired by your 2017 achievements. Have saved it\
  \ and re-reading to mentally kick me in the butt now, and maybe through 2018. Thanks\
  \ for posting!"
