comment: !!python/unicode "Just a precision. yield has nothing to do with loop in\
  \ function as you suggest (but it is true that  it is often make sens in loops).\
  \ The StopIteration occur when the function end (hit return).\nyou can still write:\n\
  def g():\n   yield 1\n   yield 2\n   yield 3\n\nwithout loop statement.  [i for\
  \ i in g()] == [1,2,3]"
