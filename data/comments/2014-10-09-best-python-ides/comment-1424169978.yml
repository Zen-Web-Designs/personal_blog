comment: !!python/unicode "I know a lot of people say this and it largely ignored,\
  \  but vim is by far the best editor out there,  and is actually pretty easy to\
  \ turn into a full featured IDE.  I highly recommend the spf-13 style of configuring\
  \ vim,  find documentation here\n\nhttps://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim\n\nWatch a\
  \ few tutorial videos.  It only took me about a day to be faster with vim than most\
  \ IDE I had used,  and the potential is practically limitless.\n\nThis post helped\
  \ me see its value \nhttp://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/"
