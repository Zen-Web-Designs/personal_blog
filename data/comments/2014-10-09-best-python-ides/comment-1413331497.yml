comment: !!python/unicode 'Very happy PyCharm user here.  I''m doubly blessed to have
  a license for the commercial edition for use at work, and since we''re using a lot
  of the advanced features of it, it''s really _really_ nice.


  I''m very much a proponent of everyone using what works best for them, I''m not
  bashing Sublime users here, I have nothing against that.  But my opinion is that
  from what I can see, it takes a fair bit of work to get Sublime setup with what
  comes out of the box with PyCharm.  Not only that, but an interactive pdb session
  is not the same as having a fully integrated rich debugging experience.  Auto-completion
  that knows Python syntax is nice, having it auto-complete with items from other
  open items is even nicer, but autocompleting with items from an imported package
  is king, and I doubt that Sublime supports that.


  You mention that you like how quickly Sublime starts up, and it''s absolutely true
  that PyCharm takes awhile.  But I feel like I save more than the 10 seconds it took
  to start up in using a tool that was actually custom designed for what I want to
  do with it.  Just my $0.02.'
