comment: !!python/unicode 'PySimpleGUI is another option.  http://www.PySimpleGUI.org
  .   With it  you can develop your GUI on your desktop or in the browser.  The code
  is the same except for the import statement.  It runs on top of tkinter, Qt, WxPython,
  and browser based using Remi.

  Zero web experience required.  Runs on Repl if you''re into that sort of thing.  https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI  both
  in tkinter mode AND as a browser based GUI using Remi.

  Requires a tiny amount of code to get a lot done.'
